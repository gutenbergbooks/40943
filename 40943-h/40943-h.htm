    </p>
    <p>
      T. B. Peterson, No. 102 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, has just published
      MISS LESLIE'S "NEW COOKERY BOOK." It comprises new and approved methods of
      preparing all kinds of Soups, Fish, Oysters, Beef, Mutton, Veal, Pork,
      Venison, Ham and Bacon, Poultry and Game, Terrapins, Turtle, Vegetables,
      Sauces, Bread, Pickles, Sweetmeats, Plain Cakes, Fine Cakes, Pies, Plain
      Desserts, Fine Desserts, Preparations for the Sick, Puddings,
      Confectionery, Rice, Indian Meal Preparations of all kinds, Miscellaneous
      Receipts, etc. etc. Also, lists of all articles in season suited to go
      together for breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, to suit large or small
      families, and much useful information and many miscellaneous subjects
      connected with general housewifery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work will have a very extensive sale, and many thousand copies will
      be sold, as all persons that have had Miss Leslie's former works, should
      get this at once, as <i>all the receipts in this book are new</i>, and
      have been fully tried and tested by the author since the publication of
      her former books, <i>and none of them whatever are contained in any other
      work but this</i>. It is the most complete Cook Book published in the
      world; and also the latest and best, as in addition to Cookery of all
      kinds and descriptions, its receipts for making cakes and confectionery
      are unequalled by any other work extant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new, excellent, and valuable Cook Book is published by T. B.
      Peterson, under the title of "MISS LESLIE'S NEW COOKERY BOOK," and is
      entirely different from any other work on similar subjects, under any
      other names, by the same author. It is an elegantly printed duodecimo
      volume, of 652 pages; and in it there will be found <i>hundreds of
      Receipts</i>&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
      useful&mdash;some ornamental&mdash;and all invaluable to every lady, miss,
      or family in the world.

      <p>
        "This is a large, well-bound volume of near seven hundred pages, and
        includes in it hundreds of receipts never before published in any of
        Miss Leslie's other works, accompanied by a well-arranged index, by
        which any desired receipt may be turned to at once. The receipts are for
        cooking all kinds of meats, poultry, game, pies, &amp;c., with
        directions for confectionery, ices, and preserves. It is entirely
        different from any former work by Miss Leslie, and contains new and
        fresh accessions of useful knowledge. The merit of these receipts is,
        that they have all been tried, and therefore can be recommended
        conscientiously. Miss Leslie has acquired great reputation among
        housekeepers for the excellence of her works on cookery, and this volume
        will doubtless enhance it. <i>It is the best book on cookery that we
        know of</i>, and while it will be useful to matrons, to young housewives
        we should think it quite indispensable. By the aid of this book, the
        young and inexperienced are brought nearly on a footing with those who
        have seen service in the culinary department, and by having it at hand
        are rendered tolerably independent of <i>help</i>, which sometimes
        becomes very refractory. The best regulated families are sometimes taken
        a little by surprise by the untimely stepping in of a friend to dinner&mdash;to
        such, Miss Leslie is the friend indeed, ready as her book is with
        instructions for the hasty production of various substitutes for meals
        requiring timely and elaborate preparation."

        "To the housekeeper, the name of Miss Leslie is a guaranty that what
        comes from her hand is not only orthodox, but good; and to the young
        wife about to enter upon the untried scenes of catering for a family, <i>Miss
        Leslie's New Cookery Book</i> may be termed a blessing. It presents
        receipts, (and practical ones too,) for preparing and cooking all kinds
        of soups, fish, oysters, meats, game, cakes, pastry, and indeed
        everything which enters into the economy of housekeeping. Their
        recommendations are that they are all practical, and the novice of the
        culinary art may enter upon her important duties with '<i>Miss Leslie's
        New Cookery Book</i>' by her side, with perfect confidence that the
        'soup' will not be spoiled, and that the dinner will be what is
        designed. How many disappointments could be avoided, how many domestic
        difficulties prevented, and how many husbands made happy, instead of
        miserable, by the use of this '<i>vade mecum</i>,' we shall not pretend
        to say; but as we have a sincere regard for every lady who reads the <i>News</i>,
        our advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
        to them all is, by all means to buy <i>Miss Leslie's New Cookery Book</i>.
        Mr. Peterson has done admirably in getting up this work: it is
        handsomely and substantially bound in cloth, gilt, and does credit to
        his business skill; the low price at which the work is sold, when we
        take the size of it into consideration, One Dollar and Twenty-five cents
        only, will doubtless give it an immense sale."

        "With such a book as <i>Miss Leslie's New Cookery Book</i>, published by
        Mr. Peterson, it is inconceivable what a vast extent of palate is
        destined to be astonished, and what a gastronomic multitude is to be
        made happy, by the delicious delicacies and substantial dishes so
        abundantly provided. Miss Leslie has in previous works shown how great
        an adept she has been in all culinary matters, and in all that relates
        to the comforts and the social enjoyment of the table around which
        cluster the good things of life. Literature is very good in its way; but
        such dishes as Miss Leslie gives a foretaste of, come up to a more
        delicious standard. Her authorship is exquisite, and is destined to
        diffuse the very essence of good taste among the fortunate people who
        sit down to good dinners and suppers, not one of whom will rise from the
        table without a blessing on <i>Miss Leslie's New Cookery Book</i>. And
        every taste is sure to be pleased, for all the receipts in this book are
        new, and to be found nowhere else, <i>and it is the best Cook Book ever
        published</i>&mdash;one which, with its hundreds of receipts, ought to
        be in the hands of every woman who has the slightest appreciation of
        convenience, comfort and economy."

        "About one thousand new receipts, never before printed, appear in this
        work, all of which have been tried before they are recommended by the
        author. All kinds of cooking and pastry; rules for the preparation of
        dinners, breakfasts, and suppers; appropriate dishes for every meal; and
        a vast quantity of other useful information, are embraced in the book.
        It is very comprehensive, and is furnished with an index for the use of
        the housewife. By the aid of Miss Leslie's peculiar happy talent in
        giving culinary directions, our girls can acquire a branch of useful
        information which is generally sadly neglected in their education, and
        thus become fitted for their duties as wives. One great advantage in <i>Miss
        Leslie's New Cookery Book</i>, is the economy which it teaches in the
        management of a household, as regards the preparations for the table.
        Peterson has done this book up in beautiful style, and it will be sent
        to any part of the Union, postage paid, upon the receipt of One Dollar
        and Twenty-five Cents. Those who know how much of the happiness of home
        depends upon well-cooked viands, neatly served up, will thank the
        accomplished authoress for this valuable contribution to domestic
        science."

        "Miss Leslie's 'New Receipts for Cooking' is perhaps better known than
        any similar collection of receipts. The very elegant volume before us,
        entitled '<i>Miss Leslie's New Cookery Book</i>,' is designed as a
        sequel and continuation to it, and should be its companion in every
        family, as the receipts are all new, and in no instance the same, even
        when their titles are similar. It contains directions for plain and
        fancy cooking, preserving, pickling; and commencing with soups, gives
        entirely new receipts for every course of an excellent dinner, to the
        jellies and confectionery of the dessert. Our readers are not strangers
        to the accuracy and minuteness of Miss Leslie's receipts, as, since the
        first number of the Gazette, she has contributed to our housekeepers'
        department. The new receipts in this volume are admirable. Many of them
        are modified from French sources, though foreign terms and designations
        are avoided. The publisher has brought it out in an extremely tasteful
        style, and no family in the world should be without it."

        there is nothing like it within the circle of her knowledge; and that
        having this, a housekeeper would need no other written guide to the
        mysteries of housekeeping. It contains hundreds of new receipts, which
        the author has fully tried and tested; and they relate to almost every
        conceivable dish&mdash;flesh, fish, and fowl, soups, sauces, and
        sweetmeats; puddings, pies, and pickles; cakes and confectionery. There
        are, too, lists of articles suitable to go together for breakfasts,
        dinners and suppers, at different seasons of the year, for plain family
        meals, and elaborate company preparations; which must be of great
        convenience. Indeed, there appears to be, as our lady friend remarked,
        everything in this book that a housekeeper needs to know; and having

        about housekeeping."

      I have endeavored to render this work a complete manual of domestic
      cookery <i>in all its branches</i>. It comprises an unusual number of
      pages, and the receipts are all practical, and <i>practicable</i>&mdash;being
      so carefully and particularly explained as to be easily comprehended by
      the merest novice in the art. Also, I flatter myself that most of these
      preparations (if faithfully and liberally followed,) will be found very
      agreeable to the general taste; always, however, keeping in mind that
      every ingredient must be of unexceptionable quality, and that good cooking
      cannot be made out of bad marketing.

    <h2>
      <a name="SOUPS" id="SOUPS"></a>SOUPS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is impossible to have good soup, without a sufficiency of good meat;
      thoroughly boiled, carefully skimmed, and moderately seasoned. Meat that
      is too bad for any thing else, is too bad for soup. Cold meat recooked,
      adds little to its taste or nourishment, and it is in vain to attempt to
      give poor soup a factitious flavor by the disguise of strong spices, or
      other substances which are disagreeable or unpalatable to at least one
      half the eaters, and frequently unwholesome. Rice and barley add to the
      insipidity of weak soups, having no taste of their own. And even if the
      meat is good, too large a proportion of water, and too small a quantity of
      animal substance will render it flat and vapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every family has, or ought to have, some personal knowledge of certain
      poor people&mdash;people to whom their broken victuals would be
      acceptable. Let then the most of their cold, fresh meat be set<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> apart for
      those who can ill afford to buy meat in market. To them it will be an
      important acquisition; while those who indulge in fine clothes, fine
      furniture, &amp;c., had best be consistent, and allow themselves the
      nourishment and enjoyment of freshly cooked food for each meal. Therefore
      where there is no absolute necessity of doing otherwise, let the soup
      always be made of meat bought expressly for the purpose, and of one sort
      only, except when the flavor is to be improved by the introduction of ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      In plain cooking, every dish should have a distinct taste of its natural
      flavor predominating. Let the soup, for instance, be of beef, mutton, or
      veal, but not of all three; and a chicken, being overpowered by the meat,
      adds nothing to the general flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soup-meat that has been boiled long enough to extract the juices
      thoroughly, becomes too tasteless to furnish, afterwards, a good dish for
      the table; with the exception of mutton, which may be eaten very well
      after it has done duty in the soup-pot, when it is much liked by many
      persons of simple tastes. Few who are accustomed to living at hotels, can
      relish hotel soups, which (even in houses where most other things are
      unexceptionable), is seldom such as can be approved by persons who are
      familiar with good tables. Hotel soups and hotel hashes, (particularly
      those that are dignified with French names), are notoriously made of cold
      scraps, leavings, and in some houses, are the absolute refuse of the
      kitchen. In most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
      cases, the sight of a hotel stock-pot would cause those who saw it, to
      forswear soup, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the directions are <i>exactly</i> followed, the soups contained in the
      following pages will be found palatable, nutritious, and easily made; but
      they require plenty of good ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard French cooks boast of their soup being "delicate." The
      English would call it "soup meagre." In such a country as America, where
      good things are abundant, there is no necessity of imbibing the flatulency
      of weak washy soups.
    </p>
    <p>
      All soups should be boiled slowly at first, that the essence of the meat
      may be thoroughly drawn forth. The lid of the pot should be kept close,
      unless when it is necessary to remove it for taking off the scum, which
      should be done frequently and carefully. If this is neglected, the scum
      will boil back again into the soup, spoil it, and make it impure or
      muddled. When no more scum arises, and the meat is all in rags, dropping
      from the bones, it is time to put in the vegetables, seasoning, &amp;c.,
      and not till then; and if it should have boiled away too much, then is the
      time to add a little <i>hot</i> water from another kettle. Add also a
      large crust of bread or two. It may now be made to boil faster, and the
      thickening must be put in. This is a table-spoonful or more of flour mixed
      to a smooth paste with a little water, and enriched with a tea-spoonful of
      good butter, or beef-dripping. This thickening is indispensable to all
      soups. Let it be stirred in well. If making<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> a rich soup that requires wine
      or catchup, let it be added the last thing, just before the soup is taken
      from the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all is quite done and thoroughly boiled, cover the bottom of a tureen
      with small squares of bread or toast, and dip or pour the soup into it,
      leaving all the bones and shreds of meat in the pot. To let any of the
      sediment get into the tureen is slovenly and vulgar. Not a particle of
      this should ever be found in a soup-plate. There are cooks who, if not
      prevented, will put all the refuse into the tureen; so that, when helped,
      the plates are half full of shreds of meat and scraps of bone, while all
      the best of the soup is kept back for the kitchen. This should be looked
      to. Servants who cannot reconcile it to their conscience to steal money or
      any very valuable articles, have frequently no hesitation in purloining or
      keeping to themselves whatever they like in the way of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soup may be colored yellow with grated carrots, red with tomato juice, and
      green with the juice of pounded spinach&mdash;the coloring to be stirred
      in after the skimming is over. These colorings are improvements both to
      its look and flavor. It may be browned with scorched flour, kept ready
      always for the purpose. Never put cloves or allspice into soup&mdash;they
      give it a blackish ashy dirt color, and their taste is so strong as to
      overpower every thing else. Both these coarse spices are out of use at
      good tables, and none are introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37"
      id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> in nice cookery but mace, nutmeg, ginger, and
      cinnamon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meat boiled in soup gives out more of its essence, when cut off the
      bone, and divided into small pieces, always removing the fat. The bones,
      however, should go in, as they contain much glutinous substance, adding to
      the strength and thickness of the soup, which cannot be palatable or
      wholesome unless all the grease is carefully skimmed off. Kitchen grease
      is used chiefly for soap-fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cold weather, good soup, if carefully covered and kept in a cool place,
      and boiled over again for half an hour <i>without</i> any <i>additional
      water</i>, will be better on the second day than on the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an excellent way in winter to boil the meat and bones on the first
      day, without any vegetables. Then, when very thick and rich, strain the
      liquid into a large pan; cover it, and set it away till next morning&mdash;it
      should then be found a thick jelly. Cut it in pieces, having scraped off
      the sediment from the bottom&mdash;then add the vegetables, and boil them
      in the soup.

      MUSHROOM SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Cut a knuckle of veal, or a neck of mutton, (or both, if they are small,)
      into large pieces, and remove the bones. Put it into a soup-pot with
      sufficient water to cover the whole, and season with a little salt and
      cayenne. Let it boil till the meat is in rags, skimming it well; then
      strain off the soup into another pot.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> Have ready a large quart, or a
      quart and a pint of freshly-gathered mushrooms&mdash;cut them into
      quarters, having removed the stalks. Put them into the soup, adding a
      quarter of a pound (or more) of fresh butter, divided into bits and rolled
      in flour. Boil the whole about half an hour longer&mdash;try if the
      mushrooms are tender, and do not take them up till they are perfectly so.
      Keep the pot lid closely covered, except when you remove the lid to try
      the mushrooms. Lay at the bottom of the tureen a large slice of buttered
      toast, (cut into small squares,) and pour the soup upon it. This is a
      company soup.

      SWEET CORN SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take a knuckle of veal, and a set of calf's feet. Put them into a soup-pot
      with some cold boiled ham cut into pieces, and season them with pepper
      only. Having allowed a quart of water to each pound of meat, pour it on,
      and let it boil till the meat falls from the bone; strain it, and pour the
      liquid into a clean pot. If you live in the country, or where milk is
      plenty, make this soup of milk without any water. All white soups are best
      of milk. You may boil in this, with the veal and feet, an old fowl, (cut
      into pieces,) that is too tough for any other purpose. When the soup is
      well boiled, and the shreds all strained away, have ready (cooked by
      themselves in another pot) some ears of sweet corn, young and tender. Cut
      the grains from the cob, mix the corn with fresh butter, sea<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>son it with
      pepper, and stir it in the strained soup. Give the whole a short boil,

      TOMATO SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take a shin or leg of beef, and cut off all the meat. Put it, with the
      bones, in a large soup-pot, and season it slightly with salt and pepper.
      Pour on a gallon of water. Boil and skim it well. Have ready half a peck
      of ripe tomatos, that have been quartered, and pressed or strained through
      a sieve, so as to be reduced to a pulp. Add half a dozen onions that have
      been sliced, and a table-spoonful of sugar to lessen a little the acid of
      the tomatos. When the meat is all to rags, and the whole thoroughly done,
      (which will not be in less than six hours from the commencement) strain it
      through a cullender, and thicken it a little with grated bread crumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This soup will be much improved by the addition of a half peck of ochras,
      peeled, sliced thin, and boiled with the tomatos till quite dissolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it goes into the tureen, see that there are no shreds of meat or
      bits of bone left in the soup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"

    <h3 class="subh">
      FAMILY TOMATO SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take four pounds of the lean of a good piece of fresh beef. The fat is of
      no use for soup, as it must be skimmed off when boiling. Cut the meat in
      pieces, season them with a little salt and pepper, and put them into a pot
      with three quarts of water. The tomatos will supply abundance of liquid.
      Of these you should have a large quarter of a peck. They should be
      full-grown, and quite ripe. Cut each tomato into four pieces, and put them
      into the soup; after it has come to a boil and been skimmed. It will be
      greatly improved by adding a quarter of a peck of ochras cut into thin
      round slices. Both tomatos and ochras require long and steady boiling with
      the meat. To lessen the extreme acid of the tomatos, stir in a heaped
      table-spoonful of sugar. Add also one large onion, peeled and minced
      small; and add two or three bits of fresh butter rolled in flour. The soup
      must boil till the meat is all to rags and the tomatos and ochras entirely
      dissolved, and their forms undistinguishable. Pour it off carefully from
      the sediment into the tureen, in the bottom of which have ready some
      toasted bread, cut into small squares.

      FINE TOMATO SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take some nice fresh beef, and divest it of the bone and fat. Sprinkle it
      with a little salt and pepper, and pour on water, allowing to each pound
      of meat a pint and a half (not more) of water, and boil and skim it till
      it is very thick and clear, and all the essence seems to<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> be drawn
      out of the meat. Scald and peel a large portion of ripe tomatos&mdash;cut
      them in quarters, and laying them in a stew-pan, let them cook in their
      own juice till they are entirely dissolved. When quite done, strain the
      tomato liquid, and stir into it a little sugar. In a third pan stew an
      equal quantity of sliced ochras with a very little water; they must be
      stewed till their shape can no longer be discerned. Strain separately the
      meat liquor, the tomatos, and the ochras. Mix butter and flour together
      into a lump; knead it a little, and when all the liquids are done and
      strained put them into a clean soup-pan, stir in the flour and butter, and
      give the soup one boil up. Transfer it to your tureen, and stir
      altogether. The soup made precisely as above will be perfectly smooth and
      nice. Have little rolls or milk biscuits to eat with it.

      GREEN PEA SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Make a nice soup, in the usual way, of beef, mutton, or knuckle of veal,
      cutting off all the fat, and using only the lean and the bones, allowing a
      quart of water to each pound of meat. If the meat is veal, add four or six
      calf's feet, which will greatly improve the soup. Boil it slowly, (having
      slightly seasoned it with pepper and salt,) and when it has boiled, and
      been well skimmed, and no more scum appears, then put in a quart or more
      of freshly-shelled green peas, with none among them that are old,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> hard, and
      yellow; and also a sprig or two of green mint, and a little loaf sugar.
      Boil the peas till they are entirely dissolved. Then (having removed all
      the meat and bones) strain the soup through a sieve, and return it to the
      soup-pot, (which, in the mean time, should have been washed clean,) and
      stir into it a tea-cupful of green spinach juice, (obtained by pounding
      some spinach.) Have ready (boiled, or rather stewed in another pot) a
      quart of young fresh peas, enriched with a piece of fresh butter. These
      last peas should be boiled tender, but not to a mash. After they are in,
      give the soup another boil up, and then pour it off into a tureen, in the
      bottom of which has been laid some toast cut into square bits, with the
      crust removed. This soup should be of a fine green color, and very thick.

      EXCELLENT BEAN SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Early in the evening of the day before you make the soup, wash clean a
      large quart of dried white beans in a pan of cold water, and about bedtime
      pour off that water, and replace it with a fresh panful. Next morning, put
      on the beans to boil, with only water enough to cook them well, and keep
      them boiling slowly till they have all bursted, stirring them up
      frequently from the bottom, lest they should burn. Meantime, prepare in a
      larger pot, a good soup made of a shin of beef cut into pieces, and the
      hock of a cold ham, allowing a large quart of water to each pound of meat.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Season it with pepper only, (no salt,) and put in with it a head of
      celery, split and cut small. Boil the soup (skimming it well) till the
      meat is all in rags; then take it out, leaving not a morsel in the pot,
      and put in the boiled beans. Let them boil in the soup till they are
      undistinguishable, and the soup very thick. Put some small squares of
      toast in the bottom of a tureen, and pour the soup upon it.

      There is said to be nothing better for making soup than the camp-kettle of
      the army. Many of the common soldiers make their bean soup of surpassing
      excellence.

      SPLIT PEA SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      In buying dried or split peas, see that they are not old and worm-eaten.
      Wash two quarts of them over night in two or three waters. In the morning
      make a rich soup of the lean of beef or mutton, and the hock of a ham.
      Season it with pepper, but no salt. When it has boiled, and been
      thoroughly skimmed, put in the split peas, with a head of celery cut into
      small pieces, or else two table-spoonfuls of celery seed. Let it boil till
      the peas are entirely dissolved and undistinguishable. When it is finished
      strain the soup through a sieve, divesting it of the thin shreds of meat
      and bits of bone. Then transfer it to a tureen, in which has been laid
      some square bits of toast. Stir it up to the bottom directly before it
      goes to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may boil in the soup (instead of the ham) a<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> good piece (a rib piece, or a
      fillet) of corned pork, more lean than fat. When it is done, take the pork
      out of the soup, put it on a dish, and have ready to eat with it a pease
      pudding boiled by itself, cut in thick slices and laid round the pork.
      This pudding is made of a quart of split peas, soaked all night, mixed
      with four beaten eggs and a piece of fresh butter, and tied in a cloth and
      boiled three or four hours, or till the peas have become a mass.

      ASPARAGUS SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Make in the usual way a nice rich soup of beef or mutton, seasoned with
      salt and pepper. After it has been well boiled and skimmed, and the meat
      is all to pieces, strain the soup into another pot, or wash out the same,
      and return to it the liquid. Have ready a large quantity of fine fresh
      asparagus, with the stalks cut off close to the green tops or blossoms. It
      should have been lying in cold water all the time the meat was boiling.
      Put into the soup half of the asparagus tops, and boil them in it till
      entirely dissolved, adding a tea-cupful of spinach juice, obtained by
      pounding fresh spinach in a mortar. Stir the juice well in and it will
      give a fine green color. Then add the remaining half of the asparagus;
      having previously boiled them in a small pan by themselves, till they are
      quite tender, but not till they lose their shape. Give the whole one boil
      up together. Make some nice slices of toast, (having cut off the crust.)

      leaves examined to see if any insects have crept between, quarter the
      cabbage, (removing the stalk) and with a cabbage-cutter, or a strong sharp
      knife, cut it into shreds. Or you may begin the cabbage whole and cut it
      into shreds, spirally, going round and round it with the knife. Put the
      cabbage into the clear soup, and boil it till, upon trial, by taking up a
      little on a fork, you find it quite tender and perfectly well cooked. Then

      FINE CABBAGE SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Remove the outside leaves from a fine, fresh, large cabbage. Cut the stalk
      short, and split it half-way down so as to divide the cabbage into
      quarters, but do not separate it quite to the bottom. Wash the cabbage,
      and lay it in cold water for half an hour or more. Then set it over the
      fire in a pot full of water, adding a little salt, and let it boil slowly
      for an hour and a half, or more&mdash;skimming it well. Then take it out,
      drain it, and laying it in a deep pan, pour on <i>cold</i> water, and let
      it remain till the cabbage is cold all through. Next, having drained it
      from the cold water, cut the cabbage in shreds, (as for cold-slaw,) and
      put it into a clean pot containing a quart and a pint of boiling milk into
      which you have stirred a quarter of a pound of nice fresh butter, divided
      into four bits and rolled in flour, adding a little pepper and a very
      little salt. Boil it in the milk till thoroughly done and quite tender.
      Then make some nice toast, cut it into squares, lay it in the bottom of a
      tureen, and pour the soup on it. This being made without meat is a good

      in rags, and the soup very thick, seasoning with cayenne and a few blades
      of mace, and adding, towards the last, some bits of fresh butter rolled in
      flour. Boil in another pot, one or two fine cauliflowers. They are best
      boiled in milk. When quite done and very tender, drain them, cut off the
      largest stalks, and divide the blossoms into small pieces; put them into a
      deep covered dish, lay some fresh butter among them, and keep them hot
      till the veal soup is boiled to its utmost thickness. Then strain it into

      rolled in flour. The onions should previously be peeled and sliced. When
      they are quite soft, transfer them to the soup, with the milk, &amp;c., in
      which they were cooked. Give them one boil in the soup. Then pour it off,
      or strain it into the tureen, omitting all the sediment, and bones, and

      lay them in the bottom of the tureen, and pour the soup upon them. Where
      there is no objection to onions it will be much liked.

      and let them stew till well browned. Skim them carefully. Then pour on
      more water, in the proportion of a pint to each pound of meat, and add
      eight or ten turnips pared and sliced thin, with a<span class="pagenum"><a

      goes into the pot. Season the beef with a very little salt and pepper, and
      allow a small quart of water to each pound. Grate half a dozen or more
      large carrots on a coarse grater, and put them to boil in the soup with
      some other carrots; cut them into pieces about two inches long. When all

      PORTABLE SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is a very good and nutritious soup, made first into a jelly, and then
      congealed into hard cakes, resembling glue. If well made, it will keep for
      many months in a cool, dry place, and when dissolved in hot water or
      gravy, will afford a fine liquid soup, very convenient to carry in a box
      on a journey or sea voyage, or to use in a remote place, where fresh meat
      for soup is not to be had. A piece of this glue, the size of a large
      walnut, will, when melted in water, become a pint bowl of soup; or by
      using less water, you may have it much richer. If there is time and
      opportunity, boil with the piece of soup a seasoning of sliced onion,
      sweet marjoram, sweet basil, or any herbs you choose. Also, a bit of
      butter rolled in flour.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make portable soup, take two shins or legs of beef, two knuckles of
      veal, and four unskinned calves' feet. Have the bones broken or cracked.
      Put the whole into a large clean pot that will hold four gallons of water.
      Pour in, at beginning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
      only as much water as will cover the meat well, and set it over the fire,
      to heat gradually till it almost boils. Watch and skim it carefully while
      any scum rises. Then pour in a quart of cold water to make it throw up all
      the remaining scum, and then let it come to a good boil, continuing to
      skim as long as the least scum appears. In this be particular. When the
      liquid appears perfectly clear and free from grease, pour in the remainder
      of the water, and let it boil very gently for eight hours. Strain it
      through a very clean hair sieve into a large stoneware pan, and set it
      where it will cool quickly. Next day, remove all the remaining grease, and
      pour the liquid, as quickly as possible, into a three-gallon stew-pan,
      taking care not to disturb the settlings at the bottom. Keep the pan
      uncovered, and let it boil as fast as possible over a quick fire. Next,
      transfer it to a three-quart stew-pan, and skim it again, if necessary.
      Watch it well, and see that it does not burn, as that would spoil the
      whole. Take out a little in a spoon, and hold it in the air, to see if it
      will jelly. If it will not, boil it a little longer. Till it jellies, it
      is not done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ready some small white ware preserve pots, clean, and quite dry. Fill
      them with the soup, and let them stand undisturbed till next day. Set,
      over a slow fire, a large flat-bottomed stew-pan, one-third filled with
      boiling water. Place in it the pots of soup, seeing it does not reach
      within two inches of their rims. Let the pots stand uncovered in this
      water, hot, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
      boiling, for six or seven hours. This will bring the soup to a proper
      thickness, which should be that of a stiff jelly, when hot; and when cold,
      it should be like hard glue. When finished turn out the moulds of soup,
      and wrap them up separately in new brownish paper, and put them up in
      boxes, breaking off a piece when wanted to dissolve the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Portable soup may be improved by the addition of three pounds of nice lean
      beef, to the shins, knuckles, calves' feet, &amp;c. The beef must be cut
      into bits.
    </p>

      of portable soup may be a most useful present to them.

      and rolled in flour. Pour on three quarts of milk. Set the soup-pot over
      the fire, and let it boil rather slowly, skimming it well. When it has
      boiled an hour, put in some small round dumplings, made of half a pound of
      flour mixed with a quarter of a pound of butter; divide this dough into
      equal portions, and roll them in your hands into little balls about the
      size of a large hickory nut. The soup must boil till the flesh of the
      fowls is loose on the bones, but not till it drops off. Stir in, at the
      last, the beaten yolks of three or four eggs; and let the soup remain
      about five minutes longer over the fire. Then take it up. Cut off from the
      bones the flesh of the fowls, and divide it into mouthfuls. Cut up the
      slices of ham in the same manner. Mince the livers and gizzards. Put the
      bits of fowl and ham in the bottom of a large tureen, and pour the soup
      upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This soup will be found excellent, and may be made of large old fowls,
      that cannot be cooked in any other way. If they are so old that when the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> soup is
      finished they still continue tough, remove them entirely, and do not serve

    <p>
      Similar soup may be made of a large old turkey. Also, of four rabbits.

      make the stock take a knuckle of veal, break the bones, and cut it into

      tea-spoonful of salt, (not more); put it into a soup-pot, and pour on six
      quarts of water. The hock of a cold ham will greatly improve it. Set it
      over a moderate fire, and let it boil slowly. After it comes to a boil,
      skim it well. Have ready a quarter of a peck of ochras cut into very thin
      round slices, and a quarter of a peck of tomatos cut into pieces; also a
      quart of shelled Lima beans. Season them with pepper. Put them in; and
      after the whole has boiled three hours <i>at least</i>, take four ears of
      young Indian corn, and having grated off all the grains, add them to the
      soup and boil it an hour longer. Before you serve up the soup remove from

      WINTER SOUP.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The day before you make the soup, get a leg or shin of beef. Have the bone
      sawed through in several places, and the meat notched or scored down to
      the bone. This will cause the juice or essence to come out more freely,
      when cooked. Rub it slightly with salt; cover it, and set it away. Next
      morning, early as possible, as soon as the fire is well made up, put the
      beef into a large soup-pot, allowing to each pound a small quart of water.
      Then taste the water, and if the salt that has been rubbed on the meat is
      not sufficient, add a very little more. Throw in also a tea-spoonful of
      whole pepper-corns; and you may add half a dozen blades of mace. Let it
      simmer slowly till it comes to a boil; then skim it well. After it boils,
      you may quicken the fire. At nine o'clock put in a large head of cabbage
      cut fine as for cold-slaw; six carrots grated; the leaves stripped from a
      bunch of sweet marjoram; and the leaves of a sprig of parsley. An hour
      afterwards, add six turnips, and three potatoes, all cut into four or
      eight pieces. Also two onions, which will be better if previously roasted
      brown, and then sliced. Keep the soup boiling steadily, but not hard,
      unless the dinner hour is very early. For a late dinner, there will be
      time to boil it slowly all the while; and all soups are the better for
      long and slow boiling. See that it is well skimmed, so that, when done,
      there will be not a particle of fat or scum on the surface. At dinner-time
      take it up with a large ladle, and transfer it to a tureen. In doing so,
      carefully avoid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
      shreds of meat and bone. Leave them all in the bottom of the pot, pressing
      them down with the ladle. A mass of shreds in the tureen or soup-plate
      looks slovenly and disgusting, and should never be seen at the table;
      also, they absorb too much of the liquid. Let the vegetables remain in the
      soup when it is served up, but pick out every shred of meat or bone that
      may be found in the tureen when ready to go to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      In very cold weather, what is left of this soup will keep till the second
      day; when it must be simmered again over the fire, till it just comes to a
      boil. Put it away in a tin or stone vessel. The lead which is used in
      glazing earthen jars frequently communicates its poison to liquids that
      are kept in them.

      ready a profuse quantity of fresh vegetables, such as turnips, carrots,
      parsnips, potatos, onions, and cauliflowers; also, salsify, and asparagus
      tops. Put in, first, the vegetables that require the longest boiling. They

      FRENCH POT AU FEU.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is one of the national dishes of France. The following is a genuine
      French receipt, and it would be found very palatable and very convenient
      if tried in our own land of plenty. The true French way to cook it is in
      an earthen pipkin, such as can be had in any pottery shop. The French
      vessel has a wide mouth, and close-fitting lid, with a handle at each
      side, in the form of circular ears. It is large and swelling in the
      middle, and narrows down towards the bottom. The American pipkin has a
      short thick spout at one side, and stands on three or four low feet. No
      kitchen should be without these vessels, which are cheap, very strong, and
      easily kept clean. They can sit on a stove, or in the corner of the fire,
      and are excellent for slow cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife of a French artisan commences her pot au feu soon after
      breakfast, prepares the ingre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65"
      id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>dients, puts them, by degrees, into the pot,
      attends to it during the day; and when her husband has done his work she
      has ready for him an excellent and substantial repast, far superior to
      what in our country is called a <i>tea-dinner</i>. Men frequently
      indemnify themselves for the poorness of a tea-dinner by taking a dram of
      whiskey afterwards. A Frenchman is satisfied with his excellent pot au feu
      and some fruit afterwards. The French are noted as a temperate nation. If
      they have eaten to their satisfaction they have little craving for drink.
      Yet there is no country in the world where so much good eating might be
      had as in America. But to live well, and wholesomely, there should also be
      good cooking, and the wives of our artisans must learn to think more of
      the comfort, health, and cheerfulness of him who in Scotland is called the
      <i>bread-winner</i>, than of their own finery, and their children's
      uncomfortable frippery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Receipt.</i>&mdash;For a large pot au feu, put into the pipkin six
      pounds of good fresh beef cut up, and pour on it four quarts of water. Set
      it near the fire, skim it when it simmers, and when nearly boiling, add a
      tea-spoonful of salt, half a pound of liver cut in pieces, and some black
      pepper. Then add two or three large carrots, sliced or grated on a coarse
      grater; four turnips, pared and quartered; eight young onions peeled and
      sliced thick, two of the onions roasted whole; a head of celery cut up; a
      parsnip split and cut up; and six potatos, pared, sliced, or quartered. In
      short any good vegetables now in season, including tomatos in sum<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>mer and
      autumn. Also a bunch of sweet herbs, chopped small. Let the whole continue
      to boil slowly and <i>steadily</i>; remembering to skim well. Let it
      simmer slowly five or six hours. Then, having laid some large slices of
      bread in the bottom of a tureen, or a very large pan or bowl, pour the
      stew or soup upon it; all the meat, and all the vegetables. If you have
      any left, recook it the next morning for breakfast, and <i>that day</i>
      you may prepare something else for dinner.

    <p>
      For beef you may substitute mutton, or fresh venison, if you live in a
      venison country, and can get it newly killed.

      WILD DUCK SOUP.&mdash;

      This is a company soup. If you live where wild ducks are abundant, it will
      afford an agreeable variety occasionally to make soup of some of them. If
      you suspect them to be sedgy or fishy, (you can ascertain by the smell
      when drawing or cleaning them,) parboil each duck, with a carrot put into
      his body. Then take out the carrot and throw it away. You will find that
      the unpleasant flavor has left the ducks, and been entirely absorbed by
      the carrots. To make the soup&mdash;cut up the ducks, season the pieces
      with a little salt and pepper, and lay them in a soup-pot. For a good pot
      of soup you should have four wild ducks. Add two or three sliced onions,
      and a table-spoonful of minced sage. Also a quarter of a pound of butter
      divided into four, and each piece rolled in flour. Pour in water enough to
      make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
      rich soup, and let it boil slowly till all the flesh has left the bones,&mdash;skim

      mashed with a potato beetle. A glass of Madeira or sherry will be found an
      improvement, stirred in at the last, or the juice and grated peel of a
      lemon. In taking it up for the tureen, be careful to leave all the bones
      and bits of meat in the bottom of the pot.

      VENISON SOUP.&mdash;

      Take a large fine piece of freshly killed venison. It is best at the
      season when the deer are fat and juicy, from having plenty of wild berries
      to feed on. I do not consider winter-venison worth eating, when the meat
      is poor and hard, and affords no gravy, and also is black from being kept
      too long. When venison is fresh and in good order it yields a fine soup,
      allowing a small quart of water to each pound of meat. When it has boiled
      well, and been skimmed, put in some small dumplings made of flour and
      minced suet, or drippings. Also, boiled sweet potatos, cut into round
      thick slices. You may add boiled sweet corn cut off the cob; and, indeed,
      whatever vegetables are in season. The soup-meat should boil till all the
      flesh is loose on the bones, and the bits and shreds should not be served
      up.

      GAME SOUP.&mdash;

      Take partridges, pheasants, grouse, quails, or any of the birds considered
      as game. You may put in here as many different sorts as you can procure.
      They must all be fresh killed. When they are cleaned and plucked, cut them
      in pieces as for carving, and put them into a soup-pot, with four calves'
      feet and some slices of ham, two sticks of celery, and a bundle of sweet
      herbs chopped small, and water enough to cover the whole well. Boil and
      skim well, till all the flesh is loose from the bones. Strain the liquid
      through a sieve into a clean pot, then thicken it with fresh butter rolled
      in flour. Add some force-meat balls that have been already fried; or else
      some hard-boiled yolks of eggs; some currant jelly, or some good wine into
      which a half-nutmeg has been grated; the juice of two oranges or lemons,
      and the grated yellow peel of one lemon. Give the soup another boil up,
      and then send it to table, having bread rolls to eat with it.

      All fish soups should be made with milk, (if unskimmed so much the

      or sea-bass. Cut off their heads, tails, and fins, and remove the skin,
      and the backbone, and cut the fish into pieces. To each pound of fish
      allow a quart of rich milk. Put into the soup-pot some pieces of cold

      and a few blades of mace and some grated nutmeg. Add a bunch of sweet
      marjoram, the leaves stripped from the stalks and chopped. Make some
      little dumplings of flour and butter, and put them in when the soup is
      about half done. Half an hour's steady boiling will be sufficient. Serve

      cut it into small pieces. Mash the coral into smooth bits with the back of
      a large spoon, mixing with it plenty of sweet oil; and, gradually, adding

      half-pint, otherwise boil some six eggs hard, and crumble the yolks into
      the soup. After the oysters are in give them but one boil up, just
      sufficient to plump them. If boiled longer they will shrink and shrivel

      TO CLEAN FISH.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This must always be done with the greatest care and nicety. If sent to
      table imperfectly cleaned, they are disgraceful to the cook, and
      disgusting to the sight and taste. Handle the fish lightly; not roughly so
      as to bruise it. Wash it well, but do not leave it in the water longer
      than is needful. It will lose its flavor, and become insipid, if soaked.
      To scale it, lay the fish flat upon one side, holding it firmly in the
      left hand, and with the right taking off the scales by means of a knife.
      When both sides are done, pour sufficient cold water over it to float off
      all the loose scales that may have escaped your notice. It is best to pump
      on it. Then proceed to open and empty the fish. Be sure that not the
      smallest particle of the entrails is left in. Scrape all carefully from
      the backbone. Wash out all the blood from the inside. A dexterous cook can
      draw a fish without splitting it entirely down, all the way from head to
      tail. Smelts and other small fish are drawn or emptied at the gills.
    </p>
    <p>
      All fish should be cleaned or drawn as soon as they are brought in, and
      then kept on ice, till the moment for cooking.

      TO BOIL FISH.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      No fish can be fit to eat unless the eyes are prominent and lively, the
      gills very red, and the body firm and stiff, springing back<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> immediately
      when bent round to try them. Every scale must be carefully scraped off,
      and the entrails entirely extracted; not the smallest portion being
      carelessly left sticking to the backbone. Previous to cooking, fish of
      every kind should be laid in cold water, and the blood thoroughly washed
      from the inside. Few fish are not the better for being put on to boil in
      cold water, heating gradually with it till it comes to a boil. If you put
      it on in boiling water, the outside becomes boiling hot too soon; and is
      apt to break and come off in flakes, while the inside still remains hard
      and underdone: halibut, salmon, cod, and other large thick fish must be
      boiled slowly and thoroughly throughout, taking nearly as long as meat.
      Always put salt into the water at the commencement, and a little vinegar
      towards the last. In every kitchen should be a large oval kettle purposely
      for boiling fish. This kettle has a movable strainer inside. The fish lies
      on the strainer. To try if it is done, run a thin sharp knife in it, till
      it reaches the backbone; and see if the flesh will loosen or separate
      easily. If it adheres to the bone it requires more boiling. When quite
      done, leave it no longer in the kettle, or it will lose its flavor and get
      a woolly look. Take out the strainer with the fish upon it. Drain off the
      water through the strainer, cover the fish with a folded napkin or fine
      towel, doubled thick; transfer it to a heated dish, and keep it warm and
      dry till it goes to table, directly after the soup. In the mean time
      prepare the sauce to be served up along with the fish.<span class="pagenum"><a

      FRYING FISH.&mdash;

      Fish should be fried in <i>very good</i> fresh butter, or nice beef
      drippings; or else in lard, which last, is the most usual method. A large
      allowance of lard should be put into the pan, and held over a clear fire,
      till it becomes so hot as to boil fast in the pan. Till the lard hisses
      and bubbles do not put in the fish. They must first be dried separately in
      a clean cloth, and then scored on the back in deep incisions, or gashes,
      and slightly dredged with flour. Unless the lard is amply sufficient in
      quantity to cover the fish well, and bear them up towards the surface,
      they will sink heavily to the bottom of the pan, and perhaps stick there
      and burn. Also, if there is not fat enough, the fish will absorb the whole
      of what there is, and become dark-colored and greasy.

      head, and split the fish nearly down to the tail. For a stuffing, cut two
      slices of nice light wheat bread, of shape and size to fit easily into the
      inside of the fish, and spread them thickly with very new fresh butter.
      Season them with cayenne and powdered mace, and moisten them with port
      wine or sherry. Add the juice and yellow rind of a lemon, grated; and
      sufficient powdered white sugar to take off the extreme acid of the last.
      Fill the body of the fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80"
      id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> with this stuffing, kept in by tying round
      the fish, carefully, a white cotton cord, or tape, so as to confine it in
      several places. Lay bits of fresh butter over the outside, at equal
      distances. Place the fish on a trivet, in a bake pan, and pour round it a
      pint of wine and water mixed. Baste it with this frequently while baking.
      It will require at least an hour in a quick oven. If the basting does not
      leave sufficient gravy, add half a pint more of wine mixed with a little
      hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have taken up the fish, keep it hot while you are finishing the
      gravy, which you should thicken and enrich by stirring in smoothly a piece
      of butter mixed slightly into a paste with flour, and seasoned with grated
      nutmeg. Serve up the gravy in a sauce-boat, and lay slices of lemon along
      the back of the fish, having, of course, removed the string that was wound
      around it to confine the stuffing. Send to table with the baked fish, a
      dish of potatos mashed with milk and butter, and browned on the surface
      with a salamander, or a red hot shovel. Always remove the seeds of lemon
      slices. Fresh mackerel may be baked thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish may be baked plainly, with a stuffing of sweet marjoram, minced sage,
      and onion, (previously boiled and drained,) a little butter, or finely
      chopped beef suet, and plenty of grated bread crumbs, seasoned with a
      little black pepper. Or instead of crumbs you may put in slices of bread
      and butter soaked in milk, and secured as above from falling out while the
      fish is baking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

      mixed into a smooth paste with a heaped table-spoonful of flour. Add this
      to the stew, with a bunch of sweet marjoram chopped fine, and a sprig of
      chopped parsley. If approved, add a small onion pared and sliced very

      SPICED FISH.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      Cold fish that has been left at dinner is very nice to put away for the
      supper table. It should be fresh salmon, fresh cod, rock-fish, halibut, or
      the remains of any other large fine fish. Take out the back bone, and cut
      the flesh into moderate sized pieces. Lay it in a deep dish that has a
      cover. Season the fish with cayenne pepper, a little salt, some grated
      nutmeg, and some blades of mace; also some whole black pepper-corns, and
      pour over it plenty of good cider vinegar. Tarragon vinegar will be an
      improvement. Cover it closely, and set it in a cold place till wanted. If
      in spring or summer, set it in ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not recommend cloves or allspice. The taste of those coarse spices
      is so overpowering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
      (and to many persons so unpleasant,) that they are now nearly out of use
      at good tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nutmeg, mace and ginger, will be found much better, and with cinnamon
      occasionally, are sufficient for all spice seasonings. Nevertheless, for
      those who like them, a few cloves will relieve the insipidity of halibut.

      A fine codfish should be very thick about the neck; the eyes lively; the

      it well. Boil it gently, but steadily, till thoroughly done. Then, take it
      out of the kettle, drain it, and keep it warm till ready to go to table.
      No fish should be allowed to remain in the water after the boiling is

      well; and let it boil fast till near dinner time, skimming it well. About
      half an hour before dinner, pour off this boiling water, and substitute a
      sufficiency of cold. In this last water give the fish one boil up. Send it

      The smelt is a very nice little fish, which has a peculiarly sweet and

      dredge them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
      with flour. The frying-pan must be more than two-thirds full of boiling
      lard; boiling hard when the smelts are put in, so as to float them on the
      surface. If there is not sufficient lard, or if it is not boiling, the
      fish will sink and be dark colored, and greasy. About ten minutes are
      sufficient for the small ones, and fifteen for those of a larger size.

      the back-bone, near the shoulders. Score them along the back, with deep
      gashes or incisions. Dredge them with flour, and fry them in plenty of
      lard, boiling fast when the cat-fish are put into the pan. Or, you may fry
      them in the drippings or gravy saved from roast beef, or veal. They are
      very nice dipped in a batter of beaten egg and grated bread-crumbs, or
      they may be done in a plain, though not so nice a way, with indian meal

      SALMON.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      In choosing a salmon, see that the gills are a fine red, the eyes full,
      the scales clear, and the whole fish stiff; the flesh being of the
      peculiar red known as salmon-color. Between the flakes is a substance
      called the curd, which gives it firmness. By keeping, this substance melts
      down and the flesh becomes soft. A salmon can only be eaten in perfection
      on the sea-coast where it was caught, and on the same day. To transport it
      any distance, it must be enclosed in a box, and well packed in ice. In
      America, salmon is found in the greatest perfection on the coast of Maine,
      in the Kennebec. Very fine ones are brought to Boston market. They also
      abound on the coasts of California and Oregon. The American salmon is much
      larger than those of Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"
      id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> It is so fine a fish that its own flavor is
      better than any that can be communicated except by the most simple sauce.
      It requires as much boiling as meat, that is, a quarter of an hour for
      every pound. It is in season from May till August or September.

      The lake salmon is good, but inferior to that of the ocean, in size,

      In boiling a large fish, to judge if it is done, draw up the strainer or
      fish-plate, and with a thin knife try if the flesh separates easily from
      the bone. If you can loosen it immediately, it is cooked enough. It
      injures a fish to let it get cool in the water.

      BOILED SALMON.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      After carefully emptying the salmon, wash it very clean from the blood
      inside, and remove the scales. To preserve the fine color of the salmon,
      or to set the curd or creamy substance between the flakes, it should be
      put into boiling water, allowing to a gallon of water a handful of salt.
      After the water has been boiling a few minutes, and has been skimmed, put
      in the fish, (laying it on the drainer,) and let it boil moderately fast,
      skimming it well. It must be thoroughly boiled. Underdone fish of every
      kind is disgusting and unwholesome. Before it is taken from the fish
      kettle ascertain if it is sufficiently cooked, by trying if the back-bone
      easily loosens from the flesh. A quarter of an hour may be allowed for
      each pound, for a large thick salmon requires as much cooking as meat.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> When you
      take it up, drain it well, and serve it up immediately. Have ready some
      lobster sauce, or shrimp, if more convenient. To make it, mince the meat
      of a boiled lobster, mashing the coral with it, and mix it with melted or
      drawn butter, made very thick, and having but a very small portion of
      water. For shrimp sauce, boil the shrimps, take off their heads, and
      squeeze out their bodies from the shells. Thicken with them the drawn
      butter. Nothing should go with salmon that will interfere with the flavor
      of this fine fish, or give it any taste that will overpower or weaken its
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many prefer salmon with nothing more than cold butter spread on after it
      is helped. We think, ourselves, that when the butter is very good, it is
      not improved (for salmon) by the addition of flour and water; and a very
      little is sufficient. You need use nothing from the castors except
      cayenne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is usual to eat cucumbers with salmon, and no other vegetables; the
      cucumbers to be pared, sliced, laid in cold water, and dressed, and served
      up by themselves, with a little plate for each person, that the vinegar,
      &amp;c., of the cucumbers may not impart too much acid to the salmon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In places remote from the sea, a whole salmon is seldom seen at table but
      at dinner parties, or at good hotels. In a very hot climate it should not
      be seen at all. When in season, it can be bought in any quantity by the
      pound, for a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
      family. For a small dinner company, from four to six pounds will suffice.

      Cook salmon-trout in the same manner. Large fish should be helped with a
      silver fish trowel.

      BROILED FRESH MACKEREL.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Mackerel cannot be eaten too fresh, as no fish spoils so soon; for which
      reason in England mackerel is permitted to be sold on Sundays. We have
      heard in London the fishwomen crying it about the streets on Sunday
      morning before church time. And even then it is far inferior to mackerel
      taken immediately out of the sea, at the places on the coast. It is
      generally broiled, as no other cooking seems to suit it, and draw forth
      its true flavor. Split your mackerel, remove the bone, and cut off the
      heads and tails. Dredge them on both sides with flour, and sprinkle the
      inside with black pepper and a little salt. Have your gridiron very hot,
      over a clear fire, and grease the bars with lard, or chalk them to prevent
      the fish from sticking. Broil them well on both sides, and when they are
      done, and very hot, lay some bits of fresh butter upon them. Cover to keep
      them warm, and send them to table as soon as possible. They are a fine
      breakfast fish, and good at a plain dinner. For sauce, cold butter is all
      that is necessary, but you may mix with it, chopped parsley, or minced
      fennel. At the best English tables, stewed <i>gooseberries</i>, pulped
      through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
      a sieve and sweetened, is the fashionable sauce for broiled mackerel, or
      lemon-juice is squeezed profusely over the fish. To this the lovers of
      fruit with every thing, will not object.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a mackerel is fresh, the eyes will be full and lively, the gills very
      red, and the stripes or bars on the back a very dark color, (nearly
      black,) and strongly marked; and the body thick. If thin and flat below
      the shoulders, the eyes sunk, the gills pale, and the dark stripes dull
      and indistinct, the fish is unfit to eat.

      For frying, take small mackerel, as fresh as possible. Wash them, dry them

      cuts. Season them with a little salt and pepper. Go over them with beaten
      egg, and then cover them thickly with grated bread-crumbs; which, for this
      purpose, are superior to indian meal or pounded crackers. Fry them in
      boiling lard, and dish them hot. Send them to table with a dish of potatos

      FRIED HALIBUT.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      There is a great deal of eating in a halibut, as it is a fish of immense
      size, and has only the back bone. It is sold in pieces of any weight or
      quantity, and is exceedingly white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98"
      id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> and delicate in appearance. But it is so very
      insipid, that when <i>boiled</i> it has no taste at all. Therefore it is
      always broiled or fried, except at tables where economy is the chief
      consideration. If broiled, it is done in the same manner as any other
      large fish, but to make it palatable requires something to give it a
      little taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fry halibut&mdash;take a piece from the middle of the fish, wash it
      very carefully, and dry it in a clean cloth. Then cut it into thick
      fillets, extracting the bone, which is easily done with a sharp knife,
      loosening the flesh from the bone, and raising it as you proceed. Remove
      the skin. You may also cut the fillets into slices about an inch thick.
      Season with cayenne, and a very little salt. Cover them slightly with nice
      butter. Have ready in one pan plenty of grated bread-crumbs; in another a
      sufficiency of beaten yolk of egg, seasoned with powdered mace and nutmeg.
      Dip the slices first into the egg, then into the pan of bread-crumbs. Do
      this twice over, to every slice. Have ready over the fire a hot frying pan
      full of <i>boiling</i> lard. Put in the slices and fry them well. When one
      side is done, turn the other. When all are done, take them from the frying
      pan with a perforated skimmer, and drain them. Keep them hot between two
      heated dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cooked in this manner, the halibut will be sufficiently flavored and is a
      profitable fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of frying, the halibut steaks may be broiled over a clear fire, on
      a grooved gridiron. Having first buttered it, dip each steak, as above<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>, in
      bread-crumbs and egg, and lay upon each steak a large tomato opened, and
      stuffed with a forcemeat of bread-crumbs seasoned with butter, pepper, and
      mace. This will be found a very nice way of cooking halibut. Fresh cod may
      be done in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold halibut is sometimes drest as salad for the tea-table.

      BOILED TURBOT OR SHEEP'S-HEAD FISH.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      Having cleaned and washed the fish, soak it an hour or two in salt and
      water to draw off the slime. Then let it lie half an hour or more in cold
      water. Afterwards drain, and wipe it dry. Score the back deeply with a
      knife. The whiteness of the fish will be improved by rubbing it over with
      a cut lemon. The fish kettle must be large, and nicely clean. Lay the fish
      with its back downward, on the strainer of the kettle. Cover it well with
      cold water, (milk and water in equal portions will be better still,) and
      add a small spoonful of salt. Do not let it come to a boil too fast, and
      skim it carefully. When the scum has ceased to rise, diminish the heat
      under the kettle, and let it simmer for about half an hour or more; not
      allowing it to boil hard. When the fish is done, take it up carefully with
      a fish-slice; and having prepared the sauce, pour it over the fish and
      send it to table hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sauce, mix together very smoothly, with a broad-bladed knife, a
      quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and two table-spoonfuls of flour. Put
      them into a clean sauce-pan, and hold it over the fire,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> and stir
      them till melted. Then add a large salt-spoonful of powdered mace, and as
      much cayenne as will lie on a sixpence. It will be much improved by the
      addition of some boiled lobster, chopped small. When the sauce has
      simmered five minutes, add very gradually half a pint of rich cream, and
      let it come almost to a boil, stirring all the time. After the fish is
      taken up, pour the sauce over it hot. Or you may send it to table in a
      sauce-boat. In this case ornament the fish with the coral of the lobster
      put on in a handsome figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way of dressing this fish is, after it has been boiled, to set it
      on ice to get cold; and then, having carefully removed the bones, cut the
      flesh into small squares, put it into a stew-pan, and having mixed the
      above sauce, add it to the fish, and let it stew slowly in the sauce; but
      do not let it come to a boil. When thoroughly hot, take it up, and send it
      to table in a deep dish.

      Take fine <i>fresh</i> cod, and cut it into slices an inch thick,
      separated from the bones. Lay the pieces of fish in the bottom of a

      celery; or a bunch of sweet herbs tied together. Add a pint of oyster
      liquor, and the juice of a lemon. Cover it close, and let it stew gently
      till the fish is almost done, shaking the pan frequently. Then take a
      piece of fresh butter the size of an egg; roll it in flour, and add it to
      the stew. Also, put in two dozen large fine oysters, with what liquor

      TO KEEP A SHAD FRESH.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      By the following process, (which we can highly recommend from experience,)
      a shad may be kept twenty-four hours, or indeed longer, so as to be
      perfectly fresh in taste and appearance. For instance, if brought <i>fresh</i>
      from market on Saturday morning, it may be broiled for breakfast on
      Sunday, and will seem like a fresh shad just from the water. Immediately
      on bringing it in, let it be scaled, cleaned, washed, split, and wiped
      dry; cutting off the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106"
      id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> and tail. Spread the shad open on a large
      flat dish. Mix well together in a cup, a heaped table-spoonful of brown
      sugar; a heaped tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper, and a tea-spoonful of fine
      salt; and then rub the mixture, thoroughly and evenly, all over the inside
      of the fish; which, of course, must be spread with the skin or outside
      downward. Cover it closely with a large tin cover or with another dish,
      and set it immediately on ice or in a very cold place, and let it rest
      till next morning, or till it is wanted for cooking. Immediately before
      you put it on the gridiron, take a clean towel and carefully wipe off the
      <i>whole of the seasoning</i>, not letting a particle of it remain round
      the edges, or anywhere else. Then put the shad on a previously heated
      gridiron, over hot coals, and broil it well. Butter it, and send it hot to
      table, where every one can season it again, according to their taste.
    </p>

    <h3 class="subh">
      PLANKED SHAD.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is the best way of cooking shad when in perfection, just out of the
      river; and it is much in use at fishing party dinners. A board or plank,
      about three inches thick and two feet square, must be provided for the
      purpose. This plank should be of well-seasoned oak or hickory, and very
      clean. A pine board will very soon catch fire and burn; besides
      communicating to the fish a taste of turpentine or rosin. Take a very fine
      shad, and (having cut off the head and tail,) split it down the back,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> clean
      it, wash it well, and wipe it dry. Sprinkle it with salt, and cayenne.
      Stand up the board before the fire till it becomes very hot, and almost
      begins to char. Then nail to the hot board the spread-open shad, with the
      back or skin-side next to the plank, securing it with a few nails, not
      driven in so hard that they cannot easily be drawn out. Begin to roast it
      with the head downward. After a while turn the other end of the plank, so
      as to place the tail downward. Turn it frequently up or down, that the
      juices of the fish may be equally dispersed throughout. When done, butter
      it with fresh butter, and send it to table on the board; under which,
      place a large dish or tray. Help it to the company off the plank. This
      mode of cooking a shad will be found superior to all others; and is so
      generally liked, that two at least will be required, one at each end of
      the table. It is much enjoyed by parties who have dinners on the banks of
      the river, and bespeak of the fishermen shad just out of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lake salmon may be cooked in this manner on a plank. Also, blue fish, and
      the lake white fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the principal household stores, shad-boards of oak are now to be
      purchased ready made. The cost is from a dollar to seventy-five cents.
      They are very strong and smooth, and furnished with thick wires crossing
      the board diagonally. Behind these the fish is to slip in without nailing.
      They are much used, and we advise every house-keeper to get one. We see
      very nice ones at Carryl's Furnishing Store, Chestnut street,
      Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>

      TO FEED OYSTERS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      When it is necessary to keep oysters a day or two before they are cooked,
      they must be kept clean and fed, otherwise they will die and spoil. Put
      them into a large tub of clean water; wash from them the mud and sand, and
      scrub them with a birch broom. Then pour off <i>that</i> water, and give
      them a clean tubful, placing the oysters with the deep or large side
      downward, and sprinkling them well, with salt mixed with it, allowing
      about a pint of salt to every two gallons of water. But if you have a very
      large quantity of oysters, add to the salt and water several handfuls of
      indian meal. Repeat this every twelve hours, with fresh water and meal.
      Always at the time of high water, oysters may be seen to open their
      shells, as if in expectation of their accustomed food. If this is<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
      carefully continued, they will remain plump and healthy for two days.

      Get two hundred or more fine large fresh oysters. Drain them from their

      have simmered, and have almost come to a boil, remove them from the fire;
      and have ready a pan of very cold water. Take out the oysters, (one at a
      time, on a fork,) and put them into the cold water. This will plump them,
      and render them firm. Having saved about half their liquor, put it into
      the stew-pan, seasoned well with blades of mace, grated nutmeg, whole
      pepper-corns, and a little cayenne. Stir in half a pint or more of thick
      rich cream; and if you cannot procure cream, an equal quantity of nice
      fresh butter divided into bits, slightly dredged with a very little flour.
      Boil the liquor by itself, and when it comes to a boil, take the oysters
      out of the cold water, and put them into the boiling liquor. In five

      out of their liquor, carefully, with a fork, picking off whatever bits of
      shell may be about them. Dry them in a clean napkin. Prepare some grated
      bread-crumbs, or pounded cracker, or soda biscuit, seasoned with cayenne
      pepper. Have ready plenty of yolk of egg beaten till very light; and to
      each egg allow a large tea-spoonful of rich cream, or of the best<span

      butter. Beat the egg and cream together. Dip each oyster first into the
      egg, &amp;c., and then into the crumbs. Repeat this twice till the oysters
      are well-coated all over. Have ready boiling, in a frying-pan, an equal
      mixture of fresh butter and lard. It must come nearly to the edge or top
      of the frying-pan, and be boiling fast when the oysters go in; otherwise
      they will be heavy and greasy, and sink to the bottom. Fry them of a
      yellow brown on both sides. Send them to table very hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oysters will be found much the best when fried in grated bread-crumbs.
      Cracker-crumbs form a hard, tough coating that is very indigestible, and
      also impairs the flavor. Use no salt in making the batter. Omit it
      entirely. It overpowers the taste of the oysters.

      ROASTED OYSTERS.&mdash;

      begin to open. The usual way now is to broil them on large gridirons of
      strong wire. Serve them up in their shells on large dishes, or on trays,
      at oyster suppers. At every plate lay an oyster knife and a clean coarse
      towel, and between every two chairs set a bucket to receive the empty
      shells. The gentlemen generally save the ladies the trouble of opening the
      oysters, by performing that office for them.

      id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Soak the bread till it is soft throughout, but not dissolved. Cover the
      oysters in the bottom of the dish, with some slices of the soaked bread,
      (drained from the liquor,) and lay upon the bread a few small bits of nice
      fresh butter. Then put in another layer of seasoned oysters; then another
      layer of soaked bread with bits of butter dispersed upon it. Repeat this
      with more layers of oysters, soaked bread, and bits of butter, till the
      dish is full, finishing with a close layer of bread on the top. Set this
      into a hot oven, and bake it, a short time only, or till it is well
      browned on the surface. Oysters require but little cooking, and this bread
      has had one baking already. The liquid that is about the bread is
      sufficient. It requires no more.

      Scolloped oysters may be cooked in large, clean, clam-shells and served up

      PICKLED OYSTERS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take a hundred fine large oysters&mdash;set them over the fire in their
      own liquor&mdash;add two ounces of nice fresh butter, and simmer them
      slowly for ten minutes; skimming them well. If they boil fast and long,
      they will become hard and shrivelled. Take them off the fire and strain
      from them their liquor; spread the oysters out on large dishes, and place
      them in the air to cool fast, or lay them in a broad pan of cold water.
      This renders them firm. Strain the liquor, and then mix with it an equal
      quantity of the best and purest clear cider-vinegar. Season (if the
      oysters are fresh,) with a small tea-spoonful of<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> salt, two dozen whole
      pepper-corns, and a table-spoonful of powdered mace and nutmeg, mixed. Let
      the liquor boil till it is reduced to little more than enough to cover the
      oysters well. Put the oysters into a tureen, or a broad stone jar. Pour
      the hot liquor over them, and let them grow quite cold before they are
      eaten. You may give them a fine tinge of pale pink color by adding to the
      liquor (while boiling,) a little prepared cochineal.

      PICKLED OYSTERS.&mdash;

      <i>For keeping.</i>&mdash;Have five or six hundred oysters of the finest
      sort and largest size. Proceed as in the foregoing receipt, but increase,
      proportionately, the quantity of spice and vinegar. Put them in stone-ware
      jars, securing the covers by pasting all round, bands or strips of thick
      white paper; and place on each jar, on the top of the liquor, a
      table-spoonful of salad oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use no other than <i>genuine cider-vinegar</i>. Much that is sold for the
      best white-wine vinegar is in reality a deleterious compound of pernicious
      drugs, that will eat up or dissolve the oysters entirely, leaving nothing
      but a sickening whitish fluid. This vinegar is at first so overpoweringly
      sharp and pungent, as to destroy, entirely, the taste of the spices; and,
      while cooking, emits a disagreeable smell. The oysters immediately become
      ragged, and in less than an hour are entirely destroyed. This vinegar acts
      in the same manner on all other pickles, and the use of it should always
      be shunned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

      <i>Drugs</i> should not be employed in any sort of cookery, though their

      OYSTER PATTIES.&mdash;

      Make sufficient puff-paste for at least a dozen small patties. Roll it out
      thick, and line with it twelve small tin patty-pans. Bake them brown in a
      brisk oven; and when done set them to cool. Have ready two or three dozen
      large, fine, fresh oysters. Wash and drain them, and put them into a
      stew-pan with no other liquid than just enough of their own liquor to keep
      them from burning. Season them with cayenne, nutmeg, and mace, and a few
      of the green tops or leaves of celery sprigs minced small. Add a quarter
      of a pound of fresh butter, divided into bits, and laid among the oysters.
      To enrich the gravy, stir in, at the last, the beaten yolks of three or
      four eggs, or some thick cream or butter. Let the oysters stew in this
      gravy about five minutes. When the patties are beginning to cool, fill
      each with one or two large oysters. If you choose, you can bake for every
      patty a small round lid of pastry, to be laid lightly on the top, so as to
      cover the oysters when they go to table. For company, make a large
      quantity of oyster patties, as they are much liked.

      OYSTER LOAVES.&mdash;

      the top of each, saving the pieces that come off. Then carefully scoop out
      most of the crumb from the inside, leaving the crust standing. Have ready

      one-fourth of their liquor into a stew-pan; adding the bread-crumbs, a
      large piece of fresh butter, some powdered nutmeg, and mace. Stew them
      about ten minutes. Then stir in two or three large table-spoonfuls of
      cream; take them off just as they are coming to a boil. If cooked too long
      the oysters will become tough and shriveled, and the cream will curdle.
      Fill the inside of your scooped loaves with the oysters, reserving as many
      large oysters as you have loaves. Place the bit of upper-crust carefully
      on the top of each, so as to cover the whole. Arrange them on a dish, and

      OYSTER OMELET.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Having strained the liquor from twenty-five oysters of the largest size,
      mince them small; omitting the hard part or gristle. If you cannot get
      large oysters, you should have forty or fifty small ones. Break into a
      shallow pan six, seven, or eight eggs, according to the quantity of minced
      oysters. Omit half the whites, and, (having beaten the eggs till very
      light, thick, and smooth,) mix the oysters gradually into them, adding a
      little cayenne pepper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119"
      id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> and some powdered nutmeg. Put three ounces
      or more of the best fresh butter into a small frying-pan, if you have no
      pan especially for omelets. Place it over a clear fire, and when the
      butter, (which should be previously cut up,) has come to a boil, put in
      the omelet-mixture; stir it till it begins to set; and fry it light brown,
      lifting the edge several times by slipping a knife under it, and taking
      care not to cook it too much or it will shrivel and become tough. When
      done, clap a large hot plate or dish on the top of the omelet, and turn it
      quickly and carefully out of the pan. Serve it up immediately. It is a
      fine breakfast dish. This quantity will make one large or two small
      omelets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clam omelets may be made as above.
    </p>
    <p>
      An omelet pan should be smaller than a common frying-pan, and lined with
      tin. In a large pan the omelet will spread too much, and become thin like
      a pancake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never turn an omelet while frying, as that will make it heavy and tough.
      When done, brown it by holding a red-hot shovel or salamander close above
      the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excellent omelets may be made of cold boiled ham, or smoked tongue; grated
      or minced small, mixed with a sufficiency of beaten eggs, and fried in

      on the lid; set it into the oven, and bake the paste well. When done,
      remove the lid, and take out the folded towel. While the paste is baking,
      prepare the oysters. Having picked off carefully any bits of shell that
      may be found about them, lay them in a sieve and drain off the liquor into
      a pan. Put the oysters into a skillet or stew-pan, with barely enough of
      the liquor to keep them from burning. Season them with whole pepper,
      blades of mace, some grated nutmeg, and some grated lemon-peel, (the
      yellow rind only,) and a little finely minced celery. Then add a large
      portion of fresh butter, divided into bits, and very slightly dredged with
      flour. Let the oysters simmer over the fire, but do not allow them to come
      to a boil, as that will shrivel them. Next beat the yolks only, of three,
      four, or five eggs, (in pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"

      of the pie; and replace it, after you have filled the dish with the
      oysters and gravy.

    <p>
      The lid of the pie may be ornamented with a wreath of leaves cut out of

      These are crabs that, having cast their old shells, have not yet assumed
      the new ones. In this, the transition state, they are considered
      delicacies. Put them into fast-boiling water, and boil them for ten
      minutes. Then take them out, drain them, wipe them very clean, and prepare
      them for frying by removing the spongy part inside and the sand-bag. Put
      plenty of fresh lard into a pan; and when it boils fast, lay in the crabs,
      and fry them well, seasoning them with cayenne. As soon as they are done
      of a nice golden color, take them out, drain off the lard back into the
      pan, and lay them on a large <i>hot</i> dish. Cover them to keep warm
      while you fry, in the same lard, all the best part of a fresh lettuce,
      chopped small. Let it fry only long enough to become hot throughout. When
      you serve up the crabs cover them with the fried lettuce. Stir into the
      gravy some cream, or a piece of nice fresh butter rolled in flour; and
      send it to table in a sauce-boat, seasoned with a little cayenne.

      TERRAPINS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      In buying terrapins select the largest and thickest. Like all other
      delicacies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
      the best are the cheapest in the end. Small poor terrapins are not worth
      the cost of the seasoning. A poor terrapin, poorly dressed, is indeed a
      poor thing, and is always recognized as such, by those who are expected to
      eat it. <i>Get fine terrapins only.</i> Put them into a pot of water that
      is boiling very hard at the time, and let them boil for about ten minutes.
      Immediately on taking them out, proceed to rub, with a coarse clean cloth,
      all the skin from the head, neck, and claws&mdash;also, the thin shell, as
      it comes loose. Having washed them in warm water, put the terrapins into a
      clean pot with fresh water, and a table-spoonful of salt, and boil them
      again till they are thoroughly done, and the paws are perfectly soft.
      Remove the toe-nails. Some terrapins require three hours. When they are
      quite soft, open them carefully, remove the spongy part, the sand-bag, the
      gall, and the entrails&mdash;it being now the custom to throw away the
      whole of the disgusting garbage, always tasteless, tough, and disagreeable
      to look at. Be careful not to break the gall, as it will give an
      unpleasant bitter taste to the whole. Cut into small pieces all the meat
      of the terrapins, put them into a stew-pan, (adding the juice they have
      yielded in cutting up, <i>but no water</i>,) and proceed to season them,
      beginning with cayenne and black pepper, to your taste; also, a handful of
      flour for the thickening. Stir all well together, and in a short time add
      four table-spoonfuls of cream, or fresh butter, and a half pint of Madeira
      or sherry to every four terrapins. If they have no eggs, make up some<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
      artificially; crumbling the yolks of hard-boiled common eggs, mashed to a
      paste with a little nice butter, and then made into balls with beaten raw
      egg. Add plenty of these to the stew, and let the whole cook together for
      a quarter of an hour longer. Serve it up hot, in a well heated covered
      dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four fine large terrapins generally make one dish; and the above is the
      usual quantity of seasoning for them.

      NEW WAY OF DRESSING TERRAPINS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      In buying terrapins, select those only that are large, fat, and
      thick-bodied. Put them whole into water that is boiling hard at the time,
      and (adding a little salt) boil them till thoroughly done throughout.
      Then, taking off the shell, extract the meat, and remove carefully the
      sand-bag and gall; also, <i>all the entrails</i>,&mdash;they are
      disgusting, unfit to eat, and are no longer served up in cooking terrapin
      for the best tables. Cut the meat into pieces, and put it into a stew-pan
      with its eggs, and sufficient fresh butter to stew it well. Let it stew
      till quite hot throughout, keeping the pan carefully covered that none of
      the flavor may escape; but shake it over the fire while stewing. In
      another pan, make a sauce of beaten yolk of egg, highly flavored with
      Madeira or sherry, and powdered nutmeg and mace, and enriched with a large
      lump of fresh butter. Stir this sauce well over the fire, and when it has<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> <i>almost</i>
      come to a boil, take it off. Send the terrapin to table hot in a covered
      dish, and the sauce <i>separately</i> in a sauce-tureen, to be used by
      those who like it, and omitted by those who prefer the genuine flavor of
      the terrapin when simply stewed with butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is now the usual mode of dressing terrapins in Maryland and Virginia,
      and will be found superior to any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      No dish of terrapins can be good unless the terrapins themselves are of
      the best quality. It is mistaken economy to buy poor ones. Besides being
      insipid and tasteless, it takes more in number to fill a dish. The females
      are the best.

      A TERRAPIN POT-PIE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take several fine large terrapins, the fattest and thickest you can get.
      Put them into a large pot of water that is boiling hard; and boil them
      half an hour or more. Then take them out of the shell, pulling off the
      outer skin and the toe-nails. Remove the sand-bag and the gall, taking
      care not to break it, or it will render the whole too bitter to be eaten.
      Take out also the entrails, and throw them away; as the custom of cooking
      them is now, very properly, exploded. Then cut up all the meat of the
      terrapins, taking care to save all the liquid that exudes in cutting up,
      and also the eggs. Season the whole with pepper, mace, and nutmeg, adding
      a little salt; and lay among it pieces of fresh butter slightly rolled in
      flour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ready an ample quantity of paste, made in the proportion of a pound
      of butter to two large quarts (or pounds) of flour, or a pound and a half
      of butter to three quarts of flour, and rolled out thick. Butter the
      inside of an iron pot, and line the sides with paste, till it reaches
      within one-third of the top. Then put in the pieces of terrapin, with the
      eggs, butter, &amp;c., and with all the liquid. Lay among the terrapin,
      square pieces of paste. Then pour in sufficient water to stew the whole
      properly. Next, cover all with a circular lid, or top-crust of paste, but
      do not fit it so closely that the gravy cannot bubble up over the edges
      while cooking. Cut a small cross slit in the top crust. Place the pot,
      with the pie, over a good fire, and boil it till the whole is thoroughly
      done, which will be in from three quarters to an hour after it comes to a
      boil. Take care not to let it get too dry, but keep at hand a kettle of
      boiling water to replenish the pot when necessary. To ascertain if the pie
      is done, lift up with a fork a little of the paste, at one side, and try
      it low down in the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be much improved, by mixing among the pieces of terrapins, (before

      meat from the shells, and cut it into mouthfuls. Have ready some fine
      large oysters drained from the liquor. Cover the bottom and sides of a
      deep dish with puff-paste; and put in a thick layer of crab or lobster,
      seasoned with a little cayenne pepper, and a grated lemon-peel. Mix it
      with some hard-boiled yolk of egg, crumbled fine, and moistened with fresh
      butter. Next, put a close layer of oysters, seasoned with pounded mace and
      grated nutmeg. Put some bits of butter rolled in flour on the top of the
      layer. Proceed in this manner with alternate layers of crab or lobster,
      and of oysters, till the dish is nearly full. Then pour in, at the last, a
      tea-cupful or more of the oyster liquor, with an equal quantity of rich
      cream. Have ready a thick lid of puff-paste. Put it on the pie, pressing
      the edges closely, so as to unite them all round; and notch them
      handsomely. Make a wreath of leaves cut out of paste, and a flower or knot
      for the centre; place them on the top-crust; and bake the pie well. While
      it is baking, prepare some balls made of chopped oysters; grated
      bread-crumbs; powdered nutmeg, or mace; and grated lemon-peel; also, some
      hard-boiled yolks of eggs, grated. Having fried these balls in butter,
      drain them, and when the pie is baked, lay a circle of them round the top,
      between the border of paste-leaves and the centre-knot.

      This pie will be found so fine that it ought to<span class="pagenum"><a

      TO DRESS A TURTLE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The turtle should be taken out of water, and killed over night in winter,
      and early in the morning in summer. Hang it up by the hind fins, and
      before it has had time to draw in its neck, cut off its head with a very
      sharp knife, and leave the turtle suspended. It should bleed two or three
      hours or more, before you begin to cut it up. Then lay it on its back upon
      a table: have at hand several vessels of cold water, in which to throw the
      most important parts as you separate them; also a large boiler of hot
      water. Take off the fins at the joint, and lay them by themselves in cold
      water; next divide the back-shell from the under-shell. The upper part of
      the turtle is called the calipash&mdash;the under part the calipee. In
      cutting open the turtle, be very careful not to break the gall, which
      should be taken out and thrown away; if broken, its bitterness will spoil
      all around it. Take out the entrails and throw them away. The practice of
      cooking them is now obsolete. So it is with the entrails of terrapins.
      Using a sharp knife, cut off the fins carefully, also the liver, lungs,
      heart, kidneys, &amp;c. Wash them well, and lay them in a pan of cold
      water, the liver in a pan by itself. If there are eggs, put them also into
      cold water. Having extracted the intestines, stand up the turtle on end,
      to let the blood run out. Afterwards cut out all<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> the flesh from the upper
      and under shells, and remove the bones. Cut the calipee (or meat belonging
      to the under-shell) into pieces about as large as the palm of your hand,
      and break the shell. The calipash, or meat next the back-shell, may be cut
      smaller&mdash;the green fat into pieces about two inches square. Put all
      the meat into a large pan, sprinkle it slightly with salt, and cover it
      up. Lay the shells and fins in a tub of boiling water, and scald them till
      the scales can be scraped off with a knife, and all the meat that still
      adheres to the shells easily removed, as it is worth saving. Clean the
      fins nicely, (taking off the dark skin,) and lay them in cold water. Wipe
      the back-shell dry, and set it aside. Then proceed to make the soup. For
      this purpose, take the coarser pieces of flesh with the bone likewise. Put
      them into a pot with a pound of cold ham cut into pieces, and eight large
      calves'-feet (two sets) that have been singed and scraped, but not
      skinned. If you cannot conveniently obtain calves'-feet, substitute a
      large fore-leg or knuckle of veal. Add four onions, sliced thin; two
      tablespoonfuls of sweet-marjoram leaves; a large bunch of basil; a dozen
      blades of mace; and a salt-spoon of cayenne. The ham will make any other
      salt unnecessary. Pour on as much water as will completely cover the
      whole, and let it simmer slowly over a steady fire during five hours,
      skimming it well. If after a while the soup seems to be boiling away too
      much, replenish it with a little hot water from a kettle, kept boiling
      hard for the purpose. When it has simmered five hours, take<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> up the
      whole, and strain the soup through a sieve into a deep pan. Wash out the
      soup-pot with hot water, and return the strained soup to it, with the
      liver, &amp;c., cut in small pieces, and some of the best of the meat, and
      a portion of the green fat. Have ready two or three dozen force-meat
      balls, the size of a hickory nut, and made of the usual proportions of
      minced veal, bread-crumbs, butter, grated lemon-peel, mace, nutmeg, and
      beaten yolk of egg. Put them into the soup, and let it boil an hour
      longer; also the eggs of the turtle, or some hard-boiled yolks of eggs.
      After it has thus boiled another hour, add the juice and grated yellow
      rinds of two lemons, and a pint of Madeira. Boil the soup a quarter of an
      hour longer, and it will then be ready for the tureen. It must never boil
      hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, stew in another pot the finest of the turtle-meat,
      seasoned with a little salt and cayenne, and a liberal allowance of
      sweet-marjoram leaves rubbed fine, and mixed with powdered mace and
      nutmeg. Add a pound of fresh butter, cut into pieces and rolled in flour.
      When the turtle-meat has stewed an hour, put in the green fat, and add the
      juice and grated yellow rinds of two lemons, and a pint or more of
      Madeira, and let the whole stew slowly an hour longer. While the meat is
      stewing, take the shell of the back; wash it clean, and wipe it dry; lay a
      band of puff-paste all round the inside of the shell, two inches below the
      edge, and two inches above it. Notch the paste handsomely, and fill the
      shell with the stewed turtle. Have ready the oven, heated as if<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> for
      bread. Lay a large iron baking-sheet or a square pan upon four bricks (one
      at each corner) to elevate the turtle-shell from the floor of the oven.
      Place on it the shell with its contents, and let it bake till well browned
      on the surface. Send it to table with the shell placed on a large dish. At
      the other end set the tureen of soup. Have ready (on two side dishes) the
      fins stewed tender in a little of the soup, and the liver fried in butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This receipt is for a turtle of moderate size. A large one will, of
      course, require an increased proportion of all the articles used in
      seasoning it&mdash;more wine, &amp;c. In serving up turtle at a
      dinner-party, let it constitute the first course, and have nothing else on
      the table while the turtle is there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen elegant silver turtle-dishes, representing the back-shell of
      the animal, superbly chased and engraved, the feet for it to stand on
      being paws of silver; and the fins having hollow places to hold the sauce.
      This was for the stew; making a dish separate from the soup, which is
      always sent to table in a tureen.

      When the meat has been all extracted, scrape and wash the large back shell
      of the turtle till it is perfectly clean. Make a rich puff-paste. Roll it
      out thin, and line with it the bottom and sides, in fact the whole of the
      back-shell. Having prepared and seasoned the best pieces of the
      turtle-meat, as in the preceding receipt, stew them till thoroughly done,
      and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>

      of the same puff-paste, rolled out rather <i>thick</i>. Cover the pie with
      it. Unite the edges of the upper and under crusts, very neatly, wetting
      your fingers with water. Then notch them handsomely all round, and cut a
      cross slit in the centre of the top or cover. Set it directly into a
      rather quick oven. Bake the crust of a light brown, and send it to table
      hot.

      LOBSTERS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      If you buy a lobster ready boiled, see that his tail is stiff and elastic,
      so that when you bend it under, it springs back immediately; otherwise he
      is not fresh. If alive or unboiled, he will be lively and brisk in his
      motion when newly caught. The same with prawns, and crabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heaviest lobsters are the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      To boil a lobster, have ready a pot of fast-boiling water, very strongly
      salted. Put in the lobster head downward; and if the water is really hot
      (it is cruel to have it otherwise,) he will be dead in a moment. Crabs, of
      course, the same. A moderate sized lobster (and they are the best,) will
      be done in half an hour. A large one requires from three-quarters to an
      hour. Before it is sent to table, the large claws should be taken off, and
      laid beside it. The head also should be separated from the body, but laid
      so near it that the division is nearly imperceptible. The head is never
      eaten. Split the body, and lay it open all<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> the way down, including the
      tail. If there is a good dresser of salads in the house, the lobster may
      be served up ready dressed, in a deep dish, seasoned with the proper
      condiments, after being cut small or minced, heaped up towards the centre
      of the dish, and decorated with the small claws laid across on the top,
      with the addition of green celery leaves, or parsley sprigs.

      LOBSTER SALAD&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      (<i>plain</i>.)&mdash;Take a well boiled lobster. Extract all the meat
      from the body and claws, cut it up small, and mash the coral with the back
      of a spoon or a broad knife. Wash the best part of a fresh lettuce, and
      cut that up also, omitting all the stalk. Mix together the chopped lobster
      and the lettuce, and put them into a salad bowl. Make the dressing in a
      deep plate, allowing for one lobster a salt-spoon of salt, half as much of
      cayenne, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, (tarragon mustard is best,) four
      table-spoonfuls (or more) of sweet oil, and three table-spoonfuls of the
      best cider vinegar. Mix all these together, with the yolks of three
      hard-boiled eggs, mashed to a soft moist paste with the other ingredients,
      adding the coral of the lobster. When they are all mixed smoothly, add
      them to the lobster and lettuce. If the mixture seems too dry, add more
      sweet oil. Toss and stir the salad with a box-wood fork. Also, the things
      should be mashed with a box-wood spoon. Cover, and set it in a cool place
      till wanted. It should be eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134"
      id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> as soon as possible after mixing, as it
      becomes flat by standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plenty of sweet oil renders a lobster wholesome. Still, persons who are
      not in good health, had best abstain from lobster.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may add to the dressing, one or two raw yolks of eggs, beaten well.

      (<i>This is for company.</i>)&mdash;Boil eight eggs for ten minutes, or
      till quite hard. Lay them in cold water, or cool them by laying bits of
      ice among them. When quite cold, cut each egg lengthways into four or six
      pieces, taking a bit off one end of each piece or slice. Cut up into long
      pieces the best part of a fresh lettuce, that has just been washed in a
      pan of cold water. Lay the lettuce in a dish, and surround it closely with
      the pieces of egg standing up on their blunted ends, with the yolk side
      outward, and forming a handsome wall all round the bed of lettuce. Upon
      this, pile neatly the bits of chopped lobster, finishing with the small
      claws stuck into the top. Have ready the dressing in a sauce-tureen. Make
      it of the beaten yolks of two raw eggs, and four table-spoonfuls of sweet
      oil, thickened with the mashed coral of the lobster, and the crumbled
      yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, and season slightly with a little salt,
      cayenne, and a spoonful of tarragon mustard. Finish with two
      table-spoonfuls of vinegar, and stir the whole hard with a box-wood spoon
      or fork.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
      Send it to table with the sauce-tureen, along with the dish of lobster,
      &amp;c. Pour on each plate of lobster a portion of this dressing. Or, if
      you can obtain no lettuce, mix this dressing at once with the chopped meat
      of the lobster. Smooth it in a pile on the dish, (keeping it towards the
      centre) and stand up the slips of hard egg handsomely surrounding it&mdash;the

      way to eat them is to pull off the head, and squeeze the body out of the

      LOBSTER SAUCE.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      Take a small hen lobster that has been well boiled. Extract all the meat,
      and chop it large. Take out the coral, and pound it smooth in a marble
      mortar, adding, as you proceed, sufficient sweet oil. Make some nice drawn
      butter, allowing half a pound of nice fresh butter to two heaped
      table-spoonfuls of flour, and a pint of hot water. Mix the butter and
      flour thoroughly, and then gradually add to them the coral, so as to give
      a fine color. Then mix this with a small pint of boiling water. Hold the
      saucepan over the fire, (shaking it about till it simmers) but do not let
      it quite boil. Put in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138"
      id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> chopped lobster, and let that simmer in the
      sauce, till well heated. To allow it to boil will spoil the color, (which
      should be pale pink,) and may be improved by a little prepared cochineal.
      Or, you may tie, in a small bit of thin muslin, a few chips of alkanet,
      and put it into the sauce, (taking it out, of course, before it goes to
      table.) Alkanet communicates a beautiful pink color, and has no taste in
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This quantity of sauce is for a large fish&mdash;salmon, cod, turbot, or
      sheep's head. There should always be an ample supply of sauce. It is very
      awkward for the sauce to give out, before it has gone round the company.

      The prime piece of beef for roasting is the sirloin; but being too large
      for a small family, the ribs are generally preferred, when there are but
      few persons to eat of it. So also is the baron, or double sirloin,
      undivided along the back. It is chiefly seen at great dinners. Except the
      sirloin and ribs, there are no very good roasting pieces, all the rest
      being generally used for stews, soups, &amp;c., and for corning or
      salting. Unless the animal is a very fine one, the inferior pieces are apt
      to be tough, hard, and coarse. The round is the best piece for corning or
      salting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
      for cooking, as beef <i>a-la-mode</i>, or converting into what, in
      England, is called rump-steaks. These steaks require a rolling-pin, before
      they can be made tender enough for good eating, or good digestion. The
      finest and tenderest steaks are those cut from the sirloin. The meat of a
      young well-fed heifer is very good; and that of an old ox, (that has done
      working, and afterwards been fattened well on plenty of wholesome food,)
      may be made of superior excellence. The lean of good fresh beef is of a
      bright red color, a fine close grain, and feels tender to the touch on
      pinching it between your thumb and finger. The fat is firm and very nearly
      white. The suet about the kidney, firm and quite white. If, on the
      contrary, the lean is coarse, tough, and of a dull color, and the fat
      scanty, yellow, and moist, do not buy that meat for any purpose. The same
      rules will apply to mutton. If the weather is so cold that the meat is
      frozen, thaw it by lying it all night or early in the morning in a tub of
      <i>cold</i> water. If thawed in water the least warm, the meat will spoil,
      and be rendered unfit to eat. Meat that has been frozen, requires a much
      longer time to cook, than if that accident had not happened. <i>All</i>
      frozen animals must be thawed in cold water previous to cooking. Cold
      roast-beef is much liked in England. In America, where meat is more
      abundant, and therefore less costly, it is not considered a proper dish to
      place before a visitor; therefore, in our country, a large piece is seldom
      cooked with a view to next day's dinner. We prefer smaller pieces,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> always
      served up fresh and hot. Beef for roasting, should be well washed in
      plenty of cold water; then dried with a clean cloth. Prepare the fire, in
      time to be burning well, when the meat is put down. It should have plenty
      of hot coals, and no part of the fire black, ashy, or smoky, and the
      hearth swept very clean: <i>for no sweeping must go on while the meat (or
      any thing else) is cooking</i>. The spit should always be kept perfectly
      clean, when not in use; and well washed, wiped, and rubbed immediately
      after using. Run it evenly into the meat, which will hang crooked if not
      well balanced. When first put down, take care not to set it at once too
      close to the fire, but place it rather more than two feet distant, that
      the meat may heat gradually. If too near the fire at first, the outside
      will scorch, and leave the inside red and bloody. Underdone meat
      (foolishly called <i>rare</i>) is getting quite out of fashion, being
      unwholesome and indigestible, and to most Americans its savour is
      disgusting. To ladies and children it is always so, and even the English
      have ceased to like it. It is now seldom seen but at those public tables,
      where they consider it an object to have as little meat as possible eaten
      on the first day, that more may be left for the second day, to be made
      into indescribable messes, with ridiculous French names, and passed off as
      French dishes, by the so-called French cook, who is frequently an
      Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, baste the meat as soon as it begins to roast, with a little
      fresh butter, or fresh dripping saved from yesterday's beef. Then, when
      its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
      fat begins to drip, baste it with that, all the while it is cooking.
      Gradually move it nearer to the fire, turning the spit round frequently,
      so that the meat may be cooked equally on all sides. When it is nearly
      done, sprinkle it slightly, with a little salt. When it is quite done, and
      you take it from the spit, put it on a large hot dish, and keep it warm
      while you skim the gravy, thoroughly, so as to remove <i>all</i> the fat.
      Then mix in the gravy a small tea-cup full of hot water, and thicken it
      with a very little browned flour. Send it to table very hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general rule, a sirloin, weighing fifteen pounds, will require about
      four hours (or more) before a good steady fire. If it has been frozen, it
      will take much longer. The fatter it is the more cooking it will require.
      When sent to table, place near it, a small sauce-shell of horse-radish,
      washed, scraped fine, and moistened with the best vinegar. Put a tea-spoon
      on the top to take it with. Pickles, and a bottle of French mustard, at
      good tables, are generally accompaniments to beef or mutton, whether
      roasted or boiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dripping of roast beef, after all the fat has been removed, and the
      basting of the meat is over, should be strained into a pan, and kept in a
      cold place, with a cover; and next day, when it is congealed into a cake,
      scrape off whatever impurities may still adhere to the bottom, transfer it
      to a covered jar, and set it in the refrigerator, or where it will be
      cold. The dripping of roast beef is excellent for frying, for plain
      pie-crust, or for many other purposes. The dripping of mutton (being
      tallow)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
      is only fit for soap-fat, and will spoil any dish whatever.

      BROILED BEEF STEAKS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The best steaks are those from the tender-loin. Those from the round or
      rump require beating with a rolling-pin. A steak-mallet tears them and
      destroys the juices of the meat. Without beating they will generally be
      found too tough or hard for an American taste, though much liked in
      Europe, where tender-loin steaks are considered too expensive. But they
      are here so much preferred, that, on good tables, any others are seldom
      seen. Have all the steaks nearly of a size and shape, and about half an
      inch thick. Trim off the fat, and cut short the bone, or remove it
      altogether. Season them with black pepper, but sprinkle on no salt till
      they have done cooking; as salt, if put on at first, hardens them. Set
      your gridiron over a bed of bright clear coals, having first rubbed the
      bars with a very little beef suet, or dripping. Not mutton fat, as it will
      give the taste of tallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A beef steak cannot be cooked in perfection unless over wood coals. To
      cook them before an anthracite fire, on an upright gridiron, is more like
      toasting than broiling, and much impairs the true flavor. A gridiron of
      the usual shape, with grooved or hollow bars to catch the gravy, is best
      of all. Broil the steaks well; and when done on one side, turn each steak
      with steak tongs; or a knife and fork, and an inverted plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If onions are liked, peel and boil a few; drain and mince them, and
      sprinkle them thickly over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143"
      id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> the surface of each steak. When they are
      well done, take them off the gridiron, and transfer them to a heated dish,
      laying a small bit of butter upon it; and put another bit of butter on the
      surface of each steak, having first sprinkled them with a very little fine
      salt. What there is of their own gravy, pour round them on the dish. Send
      it to table as hot as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English custom of eating what is called <i>rare</i> or underdone beef
      or mutton, is now becoming obsolete. To ladies, especially, all food is
      disgusting that is red and bloody-looking&mdash;and physicians have
      discovered, that nothing is wholesome unless well cooked. The introduction
      of French cookery has done that much good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The onions may be stewed in butter or gravy, and served up in a
      sauce-boat, seasoned with nutmeg. At the famous beef-steak club of London,
      each guest is furnished with a small raw onion, to take on his fork, and
      rub over his empty plate, just before the steaks are served up, which is
      done one at a time, and as hot as possible, being cooked in the room.

      shreds, scarcely adhering together. Remove the fat and bone. Lay them in a

      BEEF STEAK WITH OYSTERS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take very fine tender sirloin steak, divested of fat and bone; cut them
      not larger than the palm of your hand; lay them in a stew-pan with some
      bits of fresh butter rolled in flour. Strain over them sufficient
      oyster-liquor to cook them well, and to keep them from burning, and to
      make a gravy so as to stew, but not to boil them. Season them with some
      blades of mace, some grated nutmeg, and a few whole pepper-corns. Let them
      cook till they are thoroughly done, and not the least red. Then put in
      some fine large oysters. Set the stew-pan again over the fire till the
      oysters are plump, which should be in about five or six minutes. If cooked
      too much, the oysters will toughen and shrink. When done, transfer the
      whole to a deep dish, mixing the oysters evenly among the meat. Before you<span

      CORNED OR SALTED BEEF.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      For boiling, there is no piece of corned beef so good, and so profitable,
      as the round. A large round is always better and more tender than a small
      one, if the ox has been well fed. A small round of beef is generally
      tough. In buying it, see that it looks and smells well, as sometimes beef
      is not salted till it begins to taint; and then it is done, with a view of
      disguising its unwholesome and disgusting condition, which, however, will
      immediately be manifest as soon as it is put on to boil, if not before.
      Every sort of food, the least verging on decomposition, is unfit for any
      thing but to throw away or bury. It is not necessary to buy always a whole
      round of beef. You can have it cut into a half, third part, quarter, or
      into as many pounds as you want. If very salt, lay it to soak in cold
      water the night before, or early in the morning. Half a round (weighing
      about fifteen pounds) will require about four hours to boil sufficiently.
      A whole round, double that time. It must boil very slowly. If it boils too
      fast at first, nothing will afterwards make it tender. The fire must be
      steady, and moderate, that the heat may penetrate all through, slowly and
      equally. The pot must be kept closely<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> covered, unless for a
      minute when the scum is taken off, and that must be done frequently. The
      beef should, while boiling, be turned several times in the pot. It is much
      the best way to boil it without any vegetables in the same pot; they
      imbibe too much of the fat, particularly cabbage. Boil the cabbage by
      itself in plenty of water, having first washed it well, laid it a while in
      cold water, with the head downwards, and examined it well to see if there
      are no insects between the leaves. The leaves on the very outside, should
      be removed, and the stalk cut short. Tie a string round the cabbage to
      keep it from falling apart. Put it into a pot with plenty of cold water,
      and boil it an hour. Then take it out, drain it, and lay it in a pan of
      cold water, or place it under the hydrant, for the hydrant water to run
      copiously upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cabbage is perfectly cold, wash out the pot in which it was
      parboiled, or put it into another quite clean one, and boil it another
      hour. Then take it up, and keep it warm till wanted. Before you send it to
      table, lay some bits of nice fresh butter between the inside leaves, and
      sprinkle on a little pepper. This is much nicer than preparing what is
      called drawn or melted butter to pour over the cabbage, and far more
      wholesome. Drawn butter is seldom well made, being frequently little more
      than a small morsel of butter, deluged with greasy water; and sometimes it
      is nearly all flour and water. Cabbage cooked as above will be found
      excellent, and be divested of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147"
      id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> cabbage smell which is to many persons
      disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrots are also an usual accompaniment to corned beef. They should be
      washed, scraped, cut into pieces, and split, if very large; put into
      boiling water, and cooked, according to their size, from one hour to two
      hours. Before taking them up, try with a fork if they are tender
      throughout. When done, they are best cut into slices, a little cold butter
      mixed with them, and put into a deep dish, to be helped with a spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parsnips may be dressed in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a plain family dinner, corned beef, cabbage, and carrots, cooked <i>exactly</i>
      as above, with, of course, the addition of potatos, will, on trial, be
      found excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corned beef <i>stewed</i> very slowly, in a small quantity of water,
      (barely sufficient to cover the meat,) well skimmed, and with the
      vegetables done separately, is still better than when <i>boiled</i>.
      Mustard is a good condiment for corned beef&mdash;so is vinegar to the
      cabbage. Pickles, also; French mustard is very fine with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to the round, the edgebone is the best piece for boiling. The brisket
      or plate is too fat, and should only be eaten by persons in strong health,
      and who take a great deal of exercise. No fat meat should be given to
      children. Indeed there is generally great difficulty in making them eat
      it. They are right, as it is very unwholesome for them, unless the very
      leanest bits are selected from among the mass of fat.<span class="pagenum"><a

      carrots, sliced thin, adding some thin sliced suet, or beef dripping to
      fry them in. When done, dish the meat with the vegetables laid around it;

      hard-boiled eggs crumbled fine, the yellow rind and juice of a large
      grated lemon, sweet marjoram and sweet basil chopped small, with some
      powdered nutmeg and mace. Make deep cuts or incisions all over the outside
      of the meat, and in every cut stick firmly a slip of bacon or salt pork
      put in with a larding-pin. Bring round the flap and skewer to the side of
      the round, filling in between with some of the stuffing. And pour round it
      a pint or more of port wine. Lay it in an oven, and bake it slowly till it
      is well done all through, which will require<span class="pagenum"><a

      with its own gravy under it. It is more generally eaten cold, at a supper
      party. In this case, cover it thickly all over with double parsley or
      pepper grass, so as to resemble a green bank. In the centre place a
      bouquet of natural flowers, rising from the green bank.

      BEEF BOUILLI.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      Take from six to eight pounds of a fine round of <i>fresh</i> beef. Put it
      into a soup-pot, with the remains of a piece of cold roast beef (bones and
      all) to enrich the gravy, but use no other cold meat than beef. Season it
      slightly with salt and pepper, and pour on just sufficient water to cover
      it well. Boil it slowly, and skim it well. When the scum ceases to rise,
      have ready half a dozen large carrots, cut into pieces, and put <i>them</i>
      in first. Afterwards add six turnips, quartered; a head of celery, cut
      small; half a dozen parsnips, cut in pieces; and six whole onions. Let it
      boil slowly till all the vegetables are done, and very tender.
    </p>

      Send it to table with the beef in the middle of a large dish; the
      vegetables laid all around it; and the gravy (thickened with fine grated
      bread-crumbs) in a sauce-boat. Serve up with it, white potatos, boiled
      whole; and mashed pumpkin, or winter squash.

      Cut about four pounds of lean from a cold round of beef, that tastes but

      This is an excellent way of using up the remains of a cold round of beef

      A few pounds of the lean of a <i>fresh</i> round of beef, will be still

      The dried beef, for this purpose, must be fresh and of the very best

      little fat as possible. Put the beef into a skillet, and fill up with
      boiling water. Cover it, and let it soak or steep till the water is cold.
      Then drain off that water, and pour on some more; but merely enough to
      cover the chipped beef, which you may season with a little pepper. Set it
      over the fire, and (keeping on the cover) let it stew for a quarter of an
      hour. Then roll a few bits of butter in a little flour, and add it to the
      beef, with the yolk of one or two beaten eggs. Let it stew five minutes
      longer. Take it up on a hot dish, and send it to the breakfast or

      prevent their burning, and set them over the fire to brown. When they are
      browned, add sufficient oyster-liquor to cook them, and some bits of fresh

      MEAT PIES&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      May be made in the above manner of lamb, veal, or pork. Also of venison or
      any sort of fresh meat. Pie crust for baking should be shortened with
      butter, or with the dripping of roast beef, veal, or <i>fresh</i> pork.
      Mutton or lamb dripping are unfit for pie crust, as they make it taste of
      tallow. Suet will not do at all for <i>baked</i> paste, though very good
      if the paste is to be boiled. Butter and lard will make a nice plain paste
      for pies, if both are fresh and good; the butter to be rubbed into the
      flour, mixed with a little cold water, and rolled out; the lard to be
      spread evenly all over the sheet; then folded and rolled out again. Meat
      pies should always have a bottom crust, as the gravy it imbibes makes it
      very relishing. Veal pies are insipid without the addition of some cold
      ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pies made of game should have a puff-paste, as they are generally for
      company.

      or red-neck ducks, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164"

      A BEEF STEAK POT-PIE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take two pounds or more of tender beef steaks, exclusive of the fat and
      bone, which must be omitted; the steaks from the sirloin end, cut less
      than an inch thick, and not larger than four or five inches square. Put
      them into a pot with enough water to cover them, and season them slightly
      with pepper and salt. Dredge them with a little flour, and lay on each a
      morsel of nice fresh butter. Stew the steaks for half an hour. Meanwhile
      make a large portion of paste; allowing to every quart or pound of flour,
      a small half pound of nice beef-suet, entirely freed from all its skin and
      strings, and minced with a chopper as finely as possible. To three pounds
      of beef allow four quarts of flour and not quite two pounds of suet. A
      pot-pie with but little paste in proportion to the meat, is no better than
      a stew. The paste, if good, is always much liked. Divide the minced suet
      into two halves. Rub or crumble one half the suet into the pan of flour;
      adding by degrees a little <i>cold</i> water, barely enough to make a
      stiff dough; first mixing in a small tea-spoonful of salt. Roll out the
      lump of dough into a large sheet, and spread it all over with the
      remainder of the minced suet, laid on with a broad knife. Then fold it up,
      and set it on a dish in a cool place, to get quite cold. Take a large iron
      pot, made very clean. Lay in the bottom the largest pieces of beef steak,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> and line
      round the sides with pieces of the paste, cut to fit. Next put in the
      remainder of the meat, interspersed with raw potatos sliced, (either white
      or sweet potatos,) and also pieces of the paste cut into squares, and laid
      among the meat, to which must be added the gravy saved from the stew. When
      the pot is nearly full, cover its contents with a large round or circular
      piece of paste. This must not fit <i>quite closely</i>, but a little space
      or crack must be left all around for the gravy to bubble up as it boils.
      Before you put on the lid pour in half a pint, or more, of water. Cut a
      cross-slit in the centre of the top-crust. Set the pot over a good fire,
      and let it boil steadily, till all is done, meat and paste. The
      upper-crust should be well-browned. When cooked, serve the whole upon one
      large dish, laying the brown upper-crust on the top of all. If there is
      too much gravy, send some of it to table in a sauce-boat, first skimming
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be improved by adding to the seasoning some nutmeg or powdered
      mace. These are the only spices that accord well with meat or poultry.

      POT-PIES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The preceding receipt is good for any sort of pot-pie. They are all on the
      same principle. The meat to be divested of the fat, and stewed first in a
      pot by itself, saving the gravy. The paste (of which there should always
      be an ample allowance) sufficient to line the sides of the pot all round,
      and reaching up nearly to the top, besides plenty of small square pieces
      to intersperse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
      with the meat, and an upper crust to cover the whole. At the very bottom
      the meat and gravy only, as there the paste might burn. Pot-pies may be
      made of any sort of fresh meat, or of fowls or any sort of poultry (cut
      up, as if for carving,) and previously stewed. If made of chickens or
      pigeons or rabbits, add a few slices of cold ham and put no other salt.
      For want of suet you may make the paste with butter, but it must be fresh
      and good. Allow half a pound of butter to a large quart of flour. Potato
      paste is tolerable for shortening pot-pies, if you make it half mashed
      potato and half lard. We do not recommend bread dough or any thing raised
      with yeast or soda for boiled paste; when there is no shortening, boiled
      paste is always tough and unwholesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pot-pies may be made of apples pared, cored, and quartered; of peaches
      quartered and stoned, or of any nice fruit. Fruit pot-pies should have
      butter paste, and be well sweetened with brown sugar.

      All boiled dough should be eaten warm. It falls and becomes heavy as soon

      After clearing it from the skin and strings, mince as fine as possible

      a large sheet, and spread over it, evenly, the other half of the minced
      suet. Fold it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
      flour it, roll it again, and divide it unequally into two pieces, one
      nearly three times larger than the other. Roll them out, rather thick than
      thin. Have ready a large pound and a quarter of tender-loin beef steak,
      that has been cut into thin pieces (without fat or bone, seasoned with a
      very little salt and pepper, and some nutmeg) and half-stewed, saving its
      gravy. Lay this meat upon the large thick sheet of crust; pour the stewed
      gravy among it, and add some bits of fresh butter rolled in flour. Cover
      it with the small round of paste, cut to fit, only allowing the lid large
      enough to project a little over, so as to be joined firmly by pressing it
      all round with your fingers. Do it well and securely, that it may not come

      TONGUES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Corned or salted tongues are very little in use now. They spoil so soon,
      that it is scarcely possible to obtain one that has not been salted too
      late; and when quite fresh, they have a faint, sickening, doubtful taste.
      It is best always to buy them dried and smoked. Choose the largest and
      plumpest, and with as smooth an outside or skin as you can. Put a tongue
      into soak the evening before it is to be cooked; changing the water at
      bed-time. In the morning wash it in fresh water. Trim off the root, which
      is an unsightly object, and never carved at table. But it may be cut into
      pieces, and added to pea-soup, or bean-soup, or pepper-pot. Put on the
      tongue in a large pot of cold water, and boil it steadily for five or six
      hours, till it is so tender that a straw, or a twig from a corn-broom,
      will easily penetrate it. When you find that it is thoroughly done (and
      not till then) take it up. A smoked tongue requires more boiling than a
      ham, and therefore is seldom sufficiently cooked. When quite done, peel it
      carefully, and keep it warm till dinner. If well-boiled, it will seem
      almost to melt in your mouth. When you dish it do not split it. The flavor
      is much injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
      by carving it lengthways, or in long pieces. It should be cut in round
      slices, not too thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a large party we have seen two cold tongues on one dish. One of them
      whole&mdash;the root concealed entirely with double parsley, cut paper, or
      a bunch of flowers cut out of vegetables, very ingeniously, with a sharp
      penknife&mdash;the vegetables raw, of course not to be eaten. Red roses
      made of beets, white roses or camellias of turnips, marigolds of carrots,
      &amp;c. The stems are short wooden skewers, stuck into the flowers, and
      concealed by double parsley. These vegetable bouquets can be made to look
      very well, as ornaments to cold tongue, or to the end of the shank of a
      ham, or to stick into the centre of a cold round of a-la-mode beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there are two cold tongues on one dish, it is usual to split one to
      be helped lengthways, and garnish it with the other, cut into circular
      pieces, and laid handsomely round.

      A good loin of mutton is always very fat, so that in cooking it is well to
      remove or pare off a portion of the outside fat. Unlike most other meats,
      mutton is the better for being boiled in soup. Put it into a large pot;
      allow to every pound a quart of water. Boil it slowly and skim it well,
      adding the vegetables when the scum has done rising. The vegetables should
      be sliced turnips, potatos, and grated carrots. Have ready plenty of suet
      dumplings, in the proportion of half a pound of finely minced suet to a
      pound and a quarter of flour. Rub the suet into the pan of flour, and use
      as little water as possible in mixing the dough. Make it into thick
      dumplings, rather larger round than a dollar. Boil them in a pot by
      themselves, till thoroughly done. Serve up the meat with the dumplings
      round it. Or put the dumplings in a dish by themselves, and surround the
      meat with whole turnips. This is an excellent plain dish for a private

      SAUCE FOR BOILED MUTTON.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This particularly applies to mutton that has been boiled in soup, and
      which is so very generally liked, that it is served up on tables where
      soup-meat of beef and veal is considered inadmissible. To make a suitable
      sauce to eat with it&mdash;take two or three large boiled onions; slice
      them and put them into a sauce-pan, with a piece of fresh butter slightly
      rolled in flour, a table-spoonful of <i>made</i> mustard. French mustard
      will be best; or, for want of that, two table-spoonfuls of strong tarragon
      vinegar, and a half-salt-spoon of cayenne, and some pickled cucumbers
      chopped, but not minced. Green nasturtion seeds will be still better than
      cucumbers. Put these ingredients into a small sauce-pan, adding to them a
      little of the mutton soup. Set this sauce over the fire, and when it
      simmers well, take it off, put into a sauce-boat, and keep it hot till the
      mutton goes to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep nasturtions&mdash;take the full-grown green seeds, and put them
      into a large bottle of the best <i>cider</i> vinegar, corking them
      closely. They require nothing more, and are far superior to capers.

      BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      After nicely trimming a middle-sized leg of mutton, wash, but do not soak
      it. Put it into a pot that will hold it well, and pour on rather more
      water than is sufficient to cover it. Set it over a good fire, and skim it
      as soon as it begins to boil, and continue till no more scum appears;
      having thrown in a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176"
      id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> table-spoonful of salt after the first
      skimming. After the liquid is clear, put in some turnips, pared, and, if
      large, divided into four pieces. Afterwards it should boil slowly, or
      simmer gently for about two hours or more. Send to table with it caper
      sauce; or nasturtion, which is still better. Eat it with any sort of green
      pickles. Pickles and turnips seem indispensable to boiled mutton. Do not
      mash the turnips, but let them be well drained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting boiled turnips in the sun will give them an unpleasant taste.

      MUTTON STEAKS STEWED.&mdash;

      in just sufficient water to cover the stew, and let it cook slowly till it
      is tender and well done. Serve it up hot in a deep dish, with a cover. A
      table-spoonful of tarragon mustard will improve the stew.

      When tomatos are in season, you can stew mutton or any other meat with
      tomatos only&mdash;no water. Having prepared the meat, and laid it in the

      MUTTON CHOPS BROILED.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The best steaks are those cut from the loin, about half an inch thick.
      Divest them of the bone, and remove the skin and fat. Then butter them
      slightly all over, before cooking. This will be found an improvement. The
      French go over them with salad oil, which is still better. Sprinkle on
      them a little pepper and salt. Having heated the gridiron well over a bed
      of very hot live coals, place it somewhat aslant, grease its bars with a
      little of the mutton suet, and lay on the steaks and broil them well;
      turning them three or four times, and seeing that they are not scorched or
      burnt on the outside, and red or raw when cut. Turn them with a knife and
      fork, or with steak-tongs, an instrument with which every kitchen should
      be furnished. To cook them well requires a clear glowing fire, without
      blaze or smoke. They should be done in about a quarter of an hour. When
      you take them up, turn them on a well-heated dish, and pour their gravy
      over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If onions are liked, mince one as fine as possible, and strew it over the
      steaks while broiling; or, boil and slice some onions, mix some butter
      among them, season them with pepper, and a little<span class="pagenum"><a

      Broil some mutton steaks in the above manner, and have ready some baked
      tomatos. When the steaks are dished, lay on each a large baked tomato with
      the face downward, or cover each steak with stewed tomato sauce. For
      baking, take fine ripe tomatos of the largest size. Cut out a piece from
      the stem end, and extract the seeds. Then stuff each tomato with grated
      bread-crumbs, butter, and minced sweet marjoram, or finely minced onion.

      KEBOBBED MUTTON.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is an Asiatic dish, much approved by those who have eaten it in
      Turkey or India, and it is certainly very good. Remove the skin from a
      loin of mutton, and also the whole of the fat. Divide it at every joint,
      cutting all the steaks apart, and making separate steaks of the whole
      loin. Make a mixture of grated bread-crumbs, minced sweet-herbs, a little
      salt and pepper, and some powdered nutmeg. Have ready some beaten yolk of
      egg. Dip each steak into the egg then; twice into the seasoning. Roll up
      each steak round a wooden skewer, and tie them on a spit with packthread.
      Roast them before a clear fire, with a dripping-pan under them to catch
      the gravy, which must be skimmed frequently. They must be roasted slowly
      and carefully, taking care to have them thoroughly cooked, even to the
      inmost of every roll. Baste them with just butter enough to keep<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> them
      moist. When done, carefully take the kebobs from the skewers, and send
      them to table hot. Eat with them large Spanish chestnuts, roasted and
      peeled; or else sweet potatos, split, boiled, and cut into short pieces.
      Pour the gravy into the dish under the kebobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of rolling up the kebobs, you may fasten them flat (after
      seasoning,) with the same spit going through them all, and roast them in
      that manner. They should all be of the same size and shape. To dish them,
      lay them one upon another in an even pile. Eat mushroom sauce with them,
      or any other sort that is very nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Venison steaks are very good kebobbed in this manner, at the season when
      venison can be had fresh, tender, and juicy. For sauce have stewed wild
      grapes, mashed and made very sweet with brown sugar, or grape jelly, which
      is still better; or, sauce made of fine cranberries, such as abound in the
      north-west.

      LAMB.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The vein in the neck of the fore-quarter should be blueish, and firm&mdash;otherwise
      do not buy it. If greenish or yellowish, it is tainted, and fit only for
      manure. Never buy any thing that has been kept too long. The worst may, by
      some process, be a little disguised, but nothing can render wholesome any
      article of food in which decomposition has commenced, even in the
      slightest degree. The fat should be quite white. If there is but little
      meat on the shoulder it has not been a good lamb. In America, where food
      is abundant, there is no occasion to eat any thing, that has the flavor in
      the least changed by keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fore-quarter of lamb comprises the shoulder, the neck, and the breast
      together. The hind-quarter is the loin and leg. Lamb comes in<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> season
      in the beginning of April, if the spring is not unusually backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jersey lamb is sometimes garlicky early in the season. Avoid buying it;
      you can easily tell it by the garlicky smell. It can only be rendered
      eatable by stewing, or frying it with plenty of onions. To plain roast or
      boil garlicky meat is in vain. Beef, also, is sometimes garlicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamb may be cooked in every way that is proper for mutton.
    </p>

      ROAST LAMB.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The roasting pieces for lamb are the fore-quarter, and hind-quarter; and
      the saddle, or both hind-quarters together, not having been cut apart. If
      the saddle is cooked whole, it should be of a small delicate lamb, nice
      and fat, and is then a fashionable dish at company dinners. Like all other
      young meat lamb should always be thoroughly done, not the least redness
      being left perceptible any where about it. A hind-quarter of eight pounds
      will require at least two hours&mdash;a fore-quarter, rather longer. It
      should be placed before a clear brisk fire, but not very near at first.
      Put a little water in the dripping-pan, and baste it with that till it
      begins to cook, adding a little nice fresh butter. Then place it nearer
      the fire, and when the gravy begins to fall, baste it with that, and
      repeat the basting very frequently. When the lamb drops white gravy it is
      nearly done, and you may prepare for taking it up. Skim the gravy that is
      in the dripping-pan till all the fat is taken<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> off. Then dredge over it a
      little flour, and send it to table in a gravy boat, having stirred in one
      or two table-spoonfuls of currant jelly. Lettuce is always an
      accompaniment to cold lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      In carving a fore-quarter of lamb it is usual to take off the shoulder
      from the ribs, put in a slice of fresh butter, sprinkle it with a little
      cayenne, and squeeze over the divided parts a fresh lemon cut in half; and
      put, for that purpose, on a small plate beside the carver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vegetables to be eaten with lamb are, new potatos, asparagus, green
      peas, and spinach. Mint sauce is indispensable. French cooks seldom
      understand how to make it. To do it properly, take a large bunch of fresh
      green mint, wash it, and when you have shaken the wet from them, mince the
      leaves very fine, omitting the stems. Put the leaves, when chopped, into a
      small tureen or sauce-boat, and pour on a sufficient quantity of the best
      cider vinegar to moisten the mint thoroughly, but not to render it the
      least liquid or thin. It should be as thick as horse-radish, prepared to
      eat with roast beef. Mix in sufficient sugar to make it very sweet. Good
      brown sugar will do. At table put a tea-spoonful on the side of your
      plate. Those who make mint sauce thin and weak, and pour it over the meat
      like gravy, know nothing about it.

      separately into the beaten egg. Then into the bread-crumbs, &amp;c. Repeat
      this a second time both with the egg and bread. The cutlets will be found
      much better for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
      the double immersion. Then lay them separately in the boiling lard, and

      of the fat of ham, bacon, or corned pork. All these slips must be of the
      same size. Take one at a time between the points of the larding-needle,
      and draw it through the flat surface of the top, or upper side of the
      meat, so as to leave one end of the ham in, as you slip the other end out
      of the needle. Do this nicely, arranging the slips of ham in regular form,
      and very near together. Put the lamb into an iron oven, or bake-pan, with
      a small portion of lard or fresh butter under it, and bake it thoroughly.
      When the meat is about half done, put in a quart or more of nice green
      peas with sufficient butter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187"

      peas round it, on the same dish.

      LAMB PIE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Remove the fat and bone from two pounds or more of nice lamb steaks, or
      take some cutlets from the upper end of a leg of lamb, and cut them into
      pieces about as large as the palm of your hand. Season them with pepper
      and salt very slightly. Put them into a stew pot with a <i>very little
      water</i>, and let them stew for half an hour or more. In the mean time,
      make a nice paste, allowing half a pound of fresh butter to a pound of
      flour. Mix with a broad knife half the butter with the flour, adding
      gradually enough of cold water to make a dough. Roll out the dough into a
      large thin sheet, and spread all over it with the knife the remainder of
      the butter. Fold it, sprinkle it with a little flour, and then divide it
      into two sheets, and roll out each of them. That intended for the upper
      crust to be the thickest. Line with the under crust the bottom and sides
      of a pie-dish. Put in the stewed lamb with its gravy. Intersperse some
      blades of mace. Add some potatos, sliced, and some sliced boiled turnips.
      Cover the meat thick with the green tops of boiled asparagus, and lay
      among it a few bits of fresh butter. For asparagus tops you may substitute
      boiled cauliflower seasoned with nutmeg. Put on the paste-lid, closing the
      edges with crimping them nicely. Cut a cross-slit on the top. Put the pie
      directly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
      the oven, and bake it of a light brown. Serve it up hot.

      VEAL.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Do not buy veal unless the vein in the shoulder looks blue or bright red.
      If of any other color, the veal is not fresh. A calf's head should have
      the eyes full and prominent. If they are dull and sunken, the head is
      stale. The kidney should be well covered with firm white fat. All the fat
      must be firm, dry, and white, and the lean fine in the grain, and light
      colored. If any part is found clammy or discolored, do not buy that veal.
      The best pieces of the calf are the loin and the fillet. The loin consists
      of the best and the chump end; the hind knuckle, and the fore knuckle. The
      inferior pieces are the neck, blade-bone, and breast. The brisket end of a
      breast of veal is very coarse, hard, and tough; the best end is rather
      better, having sweet-bread belonging to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veal, like all other meat, should be well washed in cold water before
      cooking. Being naturally the most tasteless and insipid of all meat, it
      requires the assistance of certain articles to give it flavor. It is too
      weak to make rich soup without various additions. But well cooked, it is
      very nice as roasted loin, fillet, or fried cutlets.<span class="pagenum"><a

      ROAST LOIN OF VEAL.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Wash the meat well in cold water, wipe it dry, and rub it slightly with
      mixed pepper and salt. Make a stuffing of bread soaked in milk, or grated
      bread-crumbs, cold ham minced, sweet marjoram minced, and the juice and
      yellow grated rind of a lemon; also, a little fresh butter. Loosen with a
      sharp knife the skin, and put the stuffing under it, skewering down the
      flap to keep it in. Put the veal to roast before a strong clear fire, and
      pour a little water in the bottom of the roaster. Baste it with this till
      the gravy begins to run. Then baste it with that. Set the spit at first
      not very close to the fire, but bring it nearer as the roasting proceeds.

      Send it to table with its own gravy, well skimmed and slightly thickened
      with a little flour.

      Always choose a fine fresh loin of veal with plenty of fat about the
      kidney. No meat spoils so soon.

    <p>
      The breast and shoulder are roasted in the same manner as the loin, of
      which two dishes may be made, the kidney end, and the chump end.

      FILLET OF VEAL.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      When a fillet is to be roasted or baked, let it be well washed, and then
      dried in a clean towel. Take out the bone, fold the flap round, and skewer
      it to the meat. Make plenty of forcemeat or stuffing, of bread soaked in
      milk, or grated dry and mixed with plenty of fresh butter, or some of the
      fat or suet finely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
      minced. Season with pepper, grated nutmeg, powdered mace, fresh lemon peel
      grated, and sweet marjoram and sweet basil minced fine. The hole that
      contained the bone must be stuffed full, and also the space between the
      flap and the side of the meat. This should be secured by three skewers.
      Dredge the meat all over lightly with flour before you put it down. At
      first, place the spit at a distance from the fire, which should be strong
      and clear. Then, as the meat begins to roast, set it nearer, and till the
      gravy begins to fall, baste it with fresh butter, or lard. Just before it
      is finished, (it will take about four hours,) dredge it with flour, and
      baste it well with its own gravy. When the meat is dished, skim the gravy,
      thicken it with a little flour, and pour it round the veal in the dish, or
      serve it in a sauce-boat.

      A ham is the usual accompaniment to roast veal, whether fillet or loin.

      into a stew-pan, adding to it the veal gravy that was left from yesterday,
      and a table-spoonful of fresh butter or lard, dredged with flour. Cover

      If you have no catchup, put in with the cold veal at the beginning, two or
      three large ripe tomatos, peeled and quartered, or sliced, and seasoned
      with powdered mace, nutmeg, and ginger; and let all stew together in gravy
      or butter. Mushroom catchup is a good substitute for tomato in hashing

      TO HASH COLD MEAT.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The best way of re-cooking cold roast meat, (veal, beef, or pork,) is to
      hash it, cutting it into mouthfuls, and stew<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>ing it in its own gravy,
      without a drop of water. For this purpose, save as much as you can of the
      dripping or gravy that fell from it when roasting. When you have done
      basting the roast meat, skim off all the fat from the surface, and strain
      the gravy through a small sieve. What is left of it, should be carefully
      set away in a cold place. Next day, when it has congealed into a cake,
      scrape it with a knife on both sides. If not wanted for immediate use, cut
      it in pieces, and put it up in a jar well covered. Use it (instead of
      water) for stews and hashes; and if well seasoned the meat will be found
      nearly as good (for a breakfast dish,) as if not previously cooked.
      Whenever it is possible, make your hashes without any water; and if you
      have saved no gravy, substitute lard, or fresh butter. But gravy or
      drippings of the same meat is best. A hash of cold meat, stewed merely in
      water, and with no seasoning but salt and pepper, is a poor thing. Cold
      potatos, when re-cooked, always remain hard and indigestible. In all
      cookery it is best to use <i>fresh vegetables</i>, even if the <i>meat</i>
      has been previously drest. Cold meat is of no use for soups or pies. It is
      better to slice it, and eat it cold&mdash;or, better still to give it the
      poor. Roast beef or mutton, if very much underdone, may be sliced and
      broiled on a gridiron, and well seasoned with pepper. Cold roast pork is
      best sliced plain, and eaten cold. Ham also.<span class="pagenum"><a

      Make a nice sauce of sweet herbs, bread-crumbs, powdered mace and nutmeg,
      butter and beaten egg. Lay the cutlets in a deep dish, (having first
      broiled them and saved the gravy,) pour the sauce over them, with the veal
      gravy added to it. Cover them, and let them rest till cold. Allow, for
      each cutlet, a sheet of foolscap paper, cut it into the shape of a heart,
      and go over it with sweet oil, or fresh butter or lard. Lay a cutlet with
      a little of the sauce upon it, on one-half of each sheet of paper; turn
      the other half over the meat. Fold a narrow rim all round, so as to unite
      both edges. Begin at the top of the heart, and pleat both edges together
      so as to form a good shape without puckering. When you come to the bottom,
      where the paper is to cover the bone, give it a few extra twists. Broil
      the cutlets slowly on a gridiron for half an hour, seeing that no blaze
      catches the papers&mdash;or put them in the oven for half an hour. If the
      papers are not too much burnt or disfigured, dish the cutlets still
      wrapped in them, to be removed by those who eat them. If the covers are
      scorched black, and ragged, take out the cutlets and lay them on a hot
      dish. Serve up with them a dish of mashed potatos or potatoe cake, browned
      on the surface with a salamander. <i>Côtelettes à la Maintenon</i>, are

      FRIED LIVER.&mdash;

      cut into slices not too thin, as that will render them hard. Take out the
      ham as soon as it is done, put it into a hot dish, and cover it closely.
      Lay the slices of liver into the gravy of the bacon that is left in the
      frying-pan, sprinkling it well with chopped parsley. It must be thoroughly
      done. Then dish with the bacon.

    <p>
      To those who like them, some onions will be thought an improvement to
      fried liver. First parboil the onions: then slice them, season them with a
      little salt and pepper, and fry them with the liver.

    <p>
      If lettuces are in season, quarter a fresh one, and lay it under the liver
      when you dish it, having previously removed the thickest part of the
      stalk. The liver of beef or sheep is not seen at good tables. It is very
      inferior to that of calf's, being hard and coarse.

      LARDED LIVER.&mdash;

      Wash and drain a nice fat calf's liver. Liver of beef or mutton is never
      seen at a good table; they are hard, coarse, and tasteless, and only eaten
      by the poor, while the livers of veal and poultry are considered very
      nice. Divide it into equal portions. Lard them thickly with small slips of
      fat bacon, inserted at regular distances with a larding-needle, and very
      near each other. Season the liver with powdered nutmeg and mace. Put into
      a stew-pan, in the bottom of which you have laid a large slice or two of
      fat bacon. Let it stew gently, till thoroughly done and tender throughout.
      When you take the liver out of the stew-pan, stir into the gravy left at
      the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
      bottom, some thick catchup, either mushroom or tomato. Do not send the
      slices of bacon to table with the liver.

      If liked, surround the liver while cooking, with small button onions,
      (peeled and washed,) and see that they are well done. Serve them up on the

      basil, and two yolks of hard-boiled eggs, grated or minced. The grated
      yellow rind of a fresh lemon will be an improvement. Make a very nice
      light paste, and line a pie dish with it. Then fill it high with the
      mixture, laying on the top several pieces of fine fresh butter. Cover it
      with a lid of paste, notching the edges handsomely, and cutting a

      TO PREPARE SWEETBREADS.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      The sweetbread belonging to the breast of the calf is far superior to that
      which is found about the throat, being larger, whiter, more tender, and
      more delicate. Always buy them in preference. They should be set
      immediately on ice, and prepared for cooking as speedily as possible, for
      they spoil very soon. Soak them in warm water till all the blood is
      discharged. Then put them into boiling water, and boil them five minutes.
      After this, lay them immediately in a pan of very cold water. This sudden
      transition from hot water to cold, will blanch or whiten them.
      Dark-colored sweetbreads make a very bad appearance. Four are generally
      sufficient for a small dish. But as, if well cooked, they are much liked,
      it is best to have six; or else eight upon two dishes. If the sweetbreads
      are to be cut up before cooking, remove and throw away the gristle or pipe
      that pervades every one. If they are to be cooked whole, you may leave the
      pipe in, to be taken out by the eaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      For company, it is usual to lard sweetbreads with slips of fat ham or
      bacon, or of cold smoked tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweetbreads are used as side-dishes at dinners, or at nice breakfasts.<span

      SWEETBREAD CROQUETTES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Having trimmed some sweetbreads nicely, and removed the gristle, parboil
      them, and then mince them very fine. Add grated bread, and season with a
      very little salt and pepper; some powdered mace and nutmeg; and some
      grated lemon-rind. Moisten the whole with cream, and make them up into
      small cones or sugar-loaves; forming and smoothing them nicely. Have ready
      some beaten egg, mixed with grated bread-crumbs. Dip into it each
      croquette, and fry them slowly in fresh butter. Serve them hot; standing
      up on the dish, and with a sprig of parsley in the top of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweetbreads should never be used unless perfectly fresh. They spoil very
      rapidly. As soon as they are brought from market they should be split
      open, and laid in cold water. Never attempt to keep sweetbreads till next
      day, except in cold weather; and then on ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar croquettes may be made of cold boiled chicken; or cold roast veal;
      or of oysters, minced raw, and seasoned and mixed as above.

      SWEETBREAD OMELET.&mdash;

      them out, set them away to cool, and afterwards mince them small, and
      season them with <i>a very little salt</i> and cayenne pepper, and some
      grated nutmeg. Beat the eggs (omitting the whites of two) till very light.
      Then mix in the chopped sweetbreads. Put three ounces or more of fresh
      butter into a small frying-pan, and place it over the fire. Stir the
      butter with a spoon, as it melts, and when it comes to a boil put in the
      mixture, stirring it awhile after it is all in. Fry it a rich brown. Heat
      the plate or dish in which you turn it out of the pan. An omelet should
      never be turned while frying. The top may be well browned by holding above
      it a salamander or red-hot shovel.

      Take four sweetbreads, and when they have been soaked and blanched,

      three large spoonfuls of the gravy of roast veal, and a quarter of a pound
      of fresh butter, cut into four bits; each bit rolled or dredged in flour.
      When the sweetbreads are done, put in the oysters, (first removing their
      gristle or hard part,) and take them out again as soon as they are
      plumped, which should be in five minutes. If allowed to boil, the oysters
      will shrivel, and become hard and tasteless. Add, at the last, two

    <p>
      Or make a gravy of uncooked trimmings of veal or beef, stewed slowly in as
      much water as will cover them well, and seasoned with pepper and salt&mdash;or,
      stew with the fresh meat, as much ham or bacon as will flavor the gravy,

      BAKED SWEETBREADS.&mdash;

      Parboil four large sweetbreads, having first blanched them. When cold,

      of nice fresh butter with a very little flour<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> mixed into it. Pour into
      the pan a glass of nice white wine, mixed with the juice and grated yellow
      rind of a lemon. Season also with grated nutmeg. Or for sauce, you may use
      mushroom catchup, with a little salad oil stirred into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not live in a place where nice fresh butter is to be obtained,
      endeavor to do without butter at all, rather than use that which is
      strong, rancid, or too salt. Bad butter tastes through every thing&mdash;spoils
      every thing, and is also extremely unwholesome, as decomposition (or in
      plain terms <i>putrefaction</i>,) has already commenced. Rather than use
      what makes all your food taste worse instead of better, try to substitute
      something else&mdash;such as beef or fresh pork drippings, suet, lard, or
      olive oil; or, molasses, honey, or stewed fruit. <i>We know</i> that with
      these it is possible to live in health for years, without tasting butter.
      Nevertheless, good butter is a good thing, and an improvement to all sorts

    <h3 class="subh">
      PORK.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Young pork has a thin rind or skin, easily indented by pressing with the
      finger, and the lean will break by pinching. If fresh, the meat is smooth
      and dry; but if damp and clammy, it is tainted. If the fat is rough with
      little kernels, the pig has had a disease resembling the measles, and to
      eat it is poisonous. Pigs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217"
      id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> have short legs, and thick necks, are the
      best. Pigs fed entirely on slop make very bad pork. They should be kept up
      for at least two months, fed with corn, and not allowed during the time of
      fattening to eat any sort of trash. No animal tastes more of its food than
      a pig. If allowed to eat the garbage of fish, they will not only have a
      fishy taste, but a smell of fish so intolerable, when cooking, that such
      pork cannot be endured in the house. During the two months that they are
      kept up to fatten, all their food must be wholesome as well as abundant,
      and it does them much good to have soap-suds given to them occasionally.
      Let them have plenty of corn, and plenty of fresh water. They will thrive
      better and make finer pork, if their pens are not allowed to be dirty. No
      animal actually likes dirt, and even pigs would be clean if they knew how.
      It is very beneficial to young pigs to wash them well in soap and water.
      We have seen this often done with great care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pork in Spain and Portugal is delicious, from being fed chiefly on the
      large chestnuts, of which there is great abundance in those countries.
      These pigs are short-legged and thick-bodied&mdash;a profitable species.
      The best pieces of a pig are the hind-leg and loin; the next is the
      shoulder, or fore-leg. The spare-rib, (pronounced sparrib by the English,)
      affords so little meat, and the bones are so tedious to pick, that it is
      seldom seen on good American tables, nothing being popular with us that
      cannot be eaten fast or fastish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pork must be thoroughly cooked; done well,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> and completely to the very
      bone. Who ever asked for a slice of pork <i>done rare</i>? Who could eat
      pork with the blood appearing, when served? So it is with veal. Underdone
      veal, or underdone chicken, is not to be thought of without disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pork, for boiling, is always previously salted or corned. Fresh pork,
      however, is very good <i>stewed</i> or cooked slowly in a very little
      water, and with plenty of vegetables in the same pot. The vegetables
      should be potatos, (either sweet or white,) pared and cut into pieces&mdash;parsnips
      the same, or yams in thick slices. For corned pork cook the vegetables
      separately from the meat, or they will taste too salt and fat. They should
      be cabbage, or green sprouts, green beans or peas, green corn, young poke,
      squash, pumpkin, or cashaw, (winter squash,) boiled, mashed, and squeezed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For salt pork, in winter, have dried beans or dried peas; first boiled,
      and then baked.

      TO ROAST PORK.&mdash;

      The roasting pieces are the loin, the leg, the saddle, the fillet, the
      shoulder and the spare-rib, (which last is found between the shoulder or
      fore-leg,) and the griskin or back-bone. All roast pork should be well
      seasoned; rubbed with pepper, salt, or powdered sage or marjoram. Score
      the skin with a sharp knife, making deep lines at regular distances, about
      an inch apart. Cross these lines with others, so as to form squares or
      diamonds. Make a stuffing of minced sage or marjoram leaves; bread-crumbs;
      if liked, a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
      little minced onion previously boiled; and some powdered mace. Introduce
      this stuffing profusely wherever it can be inserted, loosening a piece of
      the skin, and fastening it down again with a small skewer. In a leg or
      shoulder you can put in a great deal at the knuckle. In a fillet or large
      end of the leg, stuff the place from whence you have taken the bone. Put
      the pork down to roast not very close to the fire, but place it nearer
      when the skin begins to brown. You can soon baste it with its own gravy;
      and see that it is thoroughly cooked, before removing it from the spit.
      After taking up the meat, skim the fat from the gravy, and stir in a
      little flour to thicken it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crackling or skin will be much more crisp and tender if you go all
      over it with sweet oil, or lard, before you put it to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always accompany roast pork with apple sauce, served in a deep dish or a

      The pig should not be more than three weeks old. If not fat, it is unfit

      cut in half, mix all these ingredients well, and fill with them the body
      of the pig, sewing it up afterwards. Or you may make a plain stuffing of
      chopped sage and onions, boiled together, with marjoram; and mixed with
      bread-crumbs and butter. Having trussed the pig, with the fore-legs bent
      back, and the hind-legs forward, rub it <i>all over</i> with sweet oil, or
      with fresh butter tied in a rag. Lay it in a baking-pan, with a little
      water in the bottom. Then set it in an oven, not too hot, and bake it
      well, basting it frequently with butter. When done, dish it whole. Skim
      the gravy in the pan, and mix in some flour. Give it one boil up, having
      first put into it the chopped liver and heart of the pig, taken out after
      it was cooked, and stir in the beaten yolk of an egg.

    <p>
      The practice is now obsolete of dissecting a pig before it goes to table,
      splitting it down the back, and down the front, and laying the two halves
      in reverse positions, or back to back, with one half the split head at
      each side, and one ear at each end, the brains being taken out to enrich
      the gravy. All these disgusting things have been discarded by the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> better
      taste of modern epicures. And the pig is baked and comes to table whole.
      We have always thought it a most unfeminine fancy for a lady to enjoy
      eating the head of any thing, and the brain particularly.

      FILLET OF PORK.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Cut a fillet or round, handsomely and evenly, from a fine leg of fresh
      pork. Remove the bone. Make a stuffing or forcemeat of grated
      bread-crumbs; butter; a tea-spoonful of sweet marjoram, or tarragon
      leaves; and sage leaves enough to make a small table-spoonful, when minced
      or rubbed fine; all well mixed, and slightly seasoned with pepper and
      salt. Then stuff it closely into the hole from whence the bone was taken.
      Score the skin of the pork in circles to go all round the fillet. These
      circles should be very close together, or about half an inch apart. Rub
      into them, slightly, a little powdered sage. Put it on the spit, and roast
      it well, till it is thoroughly done throughout; as pork, if the least
      underdone, is not fit to eat. Place it, for the first hour, not very close
      to the fire, that the meat may get well heated all through, before the
      skin begins to harden so as to prevent the heat from penetrating
      sufficiently. Then set it as near the fire as it can be placed without
      danger of scorching. Keep it roasting steadily with a bright, good,
      regular fire, for two or three hours, or longer still if it is a large
      fillet. It may require near four hours. Baste it at the beginning with
      sweet oil (which will make the skin very crisp) or with lard. Afterwards,
      baste it with its own gravy. When done, skim the fat from the gravy, and
      then dredge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
      in a little flour to thicken it. Send the pork to table with the gravy in

      A fillet of pork is excellent stewed slowly in a very little water, having

      Take a nice leg of fresh pork; rub it well with fine salt and let it lie

      into a large pot, with just sufficient water to cover it; and let it
      simmer, slowly, during four hours; skimming it well. Then take it out, and
      lay it on a large dish. Pour the water from the pot into an earthen pan;
      skim it, and let it cool while you are skinning the pork. Then put into a
      pot, a pint of good cider vinegar, mixed with half a pound of brown sugar,
      and a pint of the water in which the pork has been boiled, and from which
      all the fat has been carefully skimmed off. Put in the pork with the upper
      side towards the bottom of the pot. Set it again over the fire, (which
      must first be increased,) and heat the inside of the pot-lid by standing
      it upright against the front of the fire. Then cover the pot closely, and
      let the pork stew for an hour and a half longer; basting it frequently
      with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
      liquid around it, and keeping the pot-lid as hot as possible that the meat
      may be well browned. When done, the pork will have somewhat the appearance
      of being coated with molasses. Serve up the gravy with it. What is left of
      the meat may be sliced cold for breakfast or luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may stew with it, when the pork is put into the pot a second time,

      PORK AND BEANS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take a good piece of pickled pork, (not very fat,) and to each pound of
      pork allow a quart of dried white beans. The bone should be removed from
      the pork, and the beans well picked and washed. The evening before they
      are wanted for cooking, put the beans and pork to soak in <i>separate pans</i>;
      and just before bed-time, drain off the water, and replace it with fresh.
      Let them soak all night. Early in the morning, drain them well from the
      water, and wash first the beans, and then the pork in a cullender. Having
      scored the skin in stripes, or diamonds, put the pork into a pot with
      fresh cold water, and the beans into another pot with sufficient cold
      water to cook them well. Season the pork with a little pepper, but, of
      course, no salt. Boil them separately and slowly till the pork is
      thoroughly done (skimming it well) and till the beans have all burst open.
      Afterwards take them out, and drain them well from the water. Then lay the
      pork in the middle of a tin pan, (there must be no liquid fat about it)
      and the beans round it, and over it, so as nearly to bury it from sight.
      Pour in a very little water, and set the dish into a hot oven, to bake or
      brown for half an hour. If kept too long in the oven the beans will<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span> become
      dry and hard. If sufficiently boiled when separate, half an hour will be
      long enough for the pork and beans to bake together. Carefully skim off
      any liquid fat that may rise to the surface. Cover the dish, and send it
      to table hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a small dish, two quarts of beans and two pounds of pork will be
      enough. To this quantity, when put to bake in the oven, you may allow a
      pint of water.

      them in a square cloth, leaving barely sufficient room for them to swell;
      but if too much space is allowed for swelling, they will be weak and
      washy. When the peas are all dissolved into a mass, turn them out of the
      cloth, and rub them through a coarse sieve into a pan. Then add a quarter
      of a pound of fresh butter, mixed well into the peas, and a very little
      pepper. Beat light, three yolks and one whole egg, and stir them into the
      peas a little at a time. Then beat the whole very hard. Dip your
      pudding-cloth into hot water; spread it out in a pan, and pour the mixture
      into it. Tie up the cloth, and put the pudding into a pot of boiling
      water. Let it boil steadily for at least an hour. When done, send it to

      three pounds of the lean of corned or salted pork. Boil them for an hour
      in separate pots. Take them up, let them grow cold, and chop them
      separately. Chop also, very fine, two pounds of the fat of bacon, and one
      pound of beef suet. When these things are all separately minced, mix them
      well together, seasoning them well with chopped sage, sweet marjoram,
      black pepper, and powdered mace. Also, if liked, two or three boiled
      onions minced very small. Have ready some of the large skins commonly used
      for these sausages. The skins must have been carefully emptied, washed,
      and scraped till quite transparent. Fill them with the above mixture,
      stuffing it in hard and evenly with a sausage-stuffer, sewing and tying
      both ends securely. Put the sausages into a brine or pickle, such as is
      made for ham, of salt, brown sugar, and molasses mixed with water, and
      strong enough to bear up an egg. Let the sausages remain a week in this
      pickle, turning them every day, and keeping it closely covered. Then take
      them out and hang them up to dry, tied in strings or links. Smoke them for
      a week over a fire of oak sticks or corn-cobs. Afterwards, rub them over
      with salad oil, which is much the better for being mixed with ashes of
      vine twigs.

    <p>
      Sausages made faithfully as above, will be found equal to the real

      HOG'S HEAD CHEESE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Hog's head cheese is always made at what is called "killing time." To make
      four cheeses of moderate size, take two large hog's heads; two sets, (that
      is eight feet,) and the noses of all the pigs that have been killed that
      day. Clean all these things well, and then boil them to rags. Having
      drained off the liquid through a cullender, spread out the things in large
      dishes, and carefully remove all the bones, even to the smallest bits.
      With a chopper mince the meat as fine as possible, and season it well with
      pepper, salt, sage, and sweet marjoram, adding some powdered mace. Having
      divided the prepared meats into four equal parts, tie up each portion
      tightly in a clean coarse cloth, and press it into a compact cake, by
      putting on heavy weights. It will be fit for use next day. In a cool dry
      place it will keep all winter. It requires no farther cooking, and is
      eaten sliced at breakfast, luncheon, or supper. If well made, and well
      seasoned with the herbs and spices, it will be found very nice for a
      relish.

      BRINE FOR PICKLING MEAT.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      To every four gallons of water allow four pounds of fine salt, two ounces
      of saltpetre, three pounds of brown sugar, and two quarts of West India
      molasses. Boil the whole together, stirring it well, and skimming it after
      stirring. When clear, let it cool. The meat being clean and dry, rub it
      all over with ground red pepper. Then put as much meat<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> into the pickling-tub as
      can be very well covered by the brine, which must be poured on cold. Let
      it remain six weeks in the pickle, (carefully taking off the scum,) and
      turning each piece every day. Afterwards, hang it till it is dry outside,
      and then smoke it well for a fortnight, hanging it high above the fire
      with the large end downward. The fire in the smoke-house should be
      steadily kept up all the time. Hickory or oak is the best wood for this
      purpose. On no account use pine, cedar, spruce, or hemlock. They will
      communicate to the meat a strong taste of turpentine, and render it
      uneatable. A fire made of corn-cobs is excellent for smoking meat, and
      they should be saved for that purpose. When the meat is smoked, rub it all
      over with ground pepper to prevent insects, and sew up all the pieces in
      new cotton cloths, coarse and thick, and then white-wash them. We have
      seen ham-covers, painted with flowers and gilded. Since California,
      gilding pervades the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pickle will be found excellent for hams, bacon, tongues, or beef.
      Meat for pickling must be very fresh, and of excellent quality. Before
      sewing it up in covers see that it is free from insects. If to go to sea,
      pack in boxes of powdered charcoal for a long voyage. For a short one,
      barrels of wood-ashes will do.

      TO CURE HAMS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      To make good hams the pork must be of the best quality. No animal tastes<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> so much
      of its food as the pig. In America, we consider a pig "killed off the
      slop" as unfit to eat; and so he is. All our pigs are kept up in a pen,
      and fattened with Indian corn, or corn meal, for several weeks previous to
      killing. A hundred pounds of corn meal, (mixed with water to about the
      consistency of very thick mush,) is said to be equal in fattening pigs to
      two hundred pounds of dry-shelled corn. They should be kept up, and well
      fed for eight weeks; and occasionally, in the country, where such fruits
      are superabundant, the pigs should have a regale of melons, peaches, &amp;c.
      This we have seen, and the pork was, of course, very fine. The hams or
      hind-quarters are considered the most valuable part of the animal. They
      are cured in various modes. But the Newbold receipt has hitherto been the
      most popular. Mr. Newbold was a Pennsylvania farmer. The following
      directions, we believe, are authentic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one hundred pounds of fine pork, take seven pounds of coarse salt,
      five pounds of brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, half an ounce of
      pearlash, and four gallons of water. Boil all together, and skim the
      pickle when cold. Pour it on the meat. Let hams or tongues remain in the
      pickling-tub eight weeks. Before it is smoked, hang it up and dry it two
      or three days. Three weeks will be sufficient for pickling beef. Previous
      to sewing the hams in cases, rub them all over with ground black pepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soap-suds given frequently to pigs, when kept up to fatten, will greatly
      promote their health.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

      BOILED HAM.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Having soaked a fine ham from early in the evening till near bed-time,
      putting it into warm water, and changing that water about ten or eleven
      o'clock&mdash;wash and brush it well in the morning, and trim it so as to
      look nicely all over. Lay at the bottom of the ham-boiler a bed of nice
      fresh hay, which will greatly improve the flavor. Let the hock bone be
      sawed off short. A long shank bone looks very awkward. Place the ham upon
      the hay&mdash;pour in plenty of cold water, and keep it simmering very
      slowly an hour before you allow it to boil. Then increase the heat
      gradually, and keep the ham boiling steadily for four, five, or six hours,
      according to its size and age. An old ham requires more soaking and
      boiling than a new one. Skim it frequently after the boiling begins. It
      will be much improved by transferring it to a spit, (having taken off the
      whole skin,) and roasting the ham, for the last two or three hours,
      basting it with its own essence. Save the skin to cover the cold ham, and
      keep it fresh. Before it goes to table cover the ham with grated
      bread-crumbs, sifted on so as to form a slight crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the ham is to be eaten cold, and is intended for company, brush it all
      over with beaten yolk of egg. Then dredge on sufficient grated crumbs to
      form a crust half an inch thick, and finish by going all over it with
      cream. Set it to brown in an oven, or put it on the spit of a roaster.
      When cold, this glazing will be found surpassingly fine. Decorate the hock
      with white paper, handsomely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239"
      id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> cut, or with a bunch of flowers cut out of
      vegetables.

    <p>
      Carve a ham in very thin slices&mdash;if cut thick, they have not the same
      taste, besides looking ungenteelly.

      BAKED HAM.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      For baking, take a small ham, or part of a large one, trimmed and made of
      good shape, cutting away whatever looks unsightly. Have the bone sawed off
      at the knuckle, or end of the hock. The evening previous to cooking, lay
      the ham in soak in a large pan of hot water. At bed-time pour off the
      water, and renew it. Keep it closely covered all night. In the morning
      wash and brush it well. Make a coarse paste of coarse flour mixed with
      water only, and roll it out about an inch thick. Line a clean iron
      bake-oven with this, and put in the ham, reserving enough of paste to
      cover the top. Pour in a very little water, merely sufficient to keep the
      ham from burning. Put on the lid of paste, and having wet the edges
      slightly press them together, so as to unite closely the top and bottom
      crust. Bake it over a steady fire, from four to five or six hours, or
      more, according to its size. When done, skim the gravy, remove the paste,
      (which is of no farther use,) and take off the skin of the ham. Dredge it
      all over with finely grated bread-crumbs, before it goes to table. A ham
      can scarcely be cooked too much, and too slow. The general fault is in
      cooking them too little, and too fast. A ham of the smallest size will
      require at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
      least four hours baking or boiling, even after it has been all night in
      soak. Save the skin whole, to cover the cold ham when it is put away in
      the pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a cooked ham is nearly all used up, take what remains, cut it all off
      from the bone, and stew the bits in a little water, till they are all to
      rags. You will find the essence an improvement to gravies, strained from
      the fragments.

      MADEIRA HAM.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is a dish only seen at dinner parties. No one can believe, for a
      moment, that hams really cooked in Madeira wine are served up every week
      at hotels, particularly at those houses where there is no other
      superfluity, and where most of the great dishes exist only in the bill of
      fare. A genuine Madeira ham is cooked as follows:&mdash;Take a ham of the
      very finest sort; should be a Westphalia one. Lay it in hot water, and
      soak it all day and all night, changing the water several times, and every
      time washing out the pan. Early in the morning of the second day, put the
      ham into a large pot of cold water, and boil it slowly during four hours,
      skimming it well. Then take it out, remove the skin entirely, and put the
      ham into a clean boiler, with sufficient Madeira wine to cover it well.
      Boil, or rather stew it, an hour longer, keeping the pot covered except
      when you remove the lid to turn the ham. When well stewed take it up,
      drain it, and strain the liquor into a porcelain-lined saucepan. Have<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> ready a
      sufficiency of powdered white sugar. Cover the ham all over with a thick
      coating of the sugar, and set it into a hot oven to bake for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mix some orange or lemon-juice with the liquor adding plenty of sugar and
      nutmeg. Give it one boil up over the fire, and serve it up in a tureen, as
      sauce to the ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is left of the ham may be cut next day into small pieces, put into a
      stew-pan, with the remains of the liquor or sauce poured over it, and
      stewed for a quarter of an hour or more. Serve it up all together in the
      same dish. While it is on the fire, add a little butter to the stew.

      BROILED HAM.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Ham for broiling or frying should be cut into thin slices the evening
      before, trimmed, and laid in a pan of boiling water, which, near bed-time,
      should be changed for cold water, and very early in the morning for
      boiling water, in which it should lie half an hour to soak still longer.
      If ham is not well soaked previously, it will, when broiled or fried, be
      disagreeably hard and salt; the salt frying out to the surface and forming
      a rough unpleasant crust, which will create thirst in the eaters for hours
      after. Much of the salt of a ham goes off in boiling, but if it is <i>not</i>
      boiled or soaked, the salt comes out to the surface and there it sticks.
      The slices being cut thin and nicely trimmed, they should be broiled on a
      very clean gridiron over a clear fire, and so<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> well done that they incline

      Ham for frying need not be <i>quite</i> so thin as for broiling. Put but

      to cook them. Break an egg over the middle of each slice, and let it cook
      till the white is set, and the yolk appears round and yellow through it.
      Before it goes to table trim off nicely the discolored and ragged edges of
      the fried eggs. They look disgusting when left on.

      Cold ham is excellent for broiling or frying, and very nice without any
      further cooking. Send it to table strewed with either nasturtion flowers,

      Beat them till very light and thick, and then stir in gradually the minced

      the lard boils, put in the omelet mixture and fry it. Occasionally slip a
      knife under the edge to keep it loose from the pan. It should be near an
      inch thick, as a ham omelet is best not to fold over. Make it a good even
      shape; and when one side is done, turn the other and brown it. You can
      turn it easily with a knife and fork, holding carefully, close to the
      omelet, the hot dish on which it is to go to table. Dredge the surface

      Omelets may be made in this manner, of smoked tongue, or oysters chopped,

      TO PREPARE BACON.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      All pieces of pork that, after pickling, are dried and smoked, come under
      the denomination of bacon; except the hind-quarters or legs, and they are
      always called ham, and are justly considered superior to any other part of
      the animal, and bring a higher price. The shoulders or fore-quarters, the
      sides or flitches, the jowl or head, and all the other parts, are
      designated as bacon; and in some places they erroneously give that name to
      the whole animal, if cured, or preserved by the process of smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare bacon for being cooked, examine it<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> well, and scrape it
      carefully, and trim off all unsightly parts. If the fat is yellow, the
      meat is rusty or tainted, and not fit to eat. So, also, if on the lean
      there are brownish or blackish spots. All sorts of food, if kept too long,
      should be thrown away at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      If perfectly good, prepare the bacon for cooking, by washing it well, and
      then soaking it for several hours in a pan full of cold water, removing
      the water once or twice during the process. If the bacon is salt and hard,
      soak it all night, changing the water at bed-time, and early in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ham should also be soaked before cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dish of broiled ham is a nice accompaniment to one of calves'
      chitterlings, at breakfast.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h3 class="subh">
      TO BOIL BACON.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Put two or three pounds of nice bacon into a pot with plenty of cold
      water, and let it simmer slowly for an hour before it begins to boil. Skim
      it well, and when no more scum rises, put in the vegetables which are
      usually eaten with bacon, and which taste better for boiling with the
      meat. These are young greens, or sprouts, very young roots and leaves of
      the poke plant, and green beans&mdash;strung and cut in half&mdash;not
      smaller. On no account should any other vegetables be boiled with bacon.
      When the bacon is so tender as to be easily pierced through with a fork,
      even in the thickest places, take it up and drain it well in a cullender
      or sieve. Remove the skin. Then take up the vegetables and drain them<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> also,
      pressing out <i>all</i> the liquid. Season them with pepper only. Send the
      meat to table with the vegetables heaped round it, on the same large dish,
      (the cabbage being chopped, but not minced fine.) Potatos, squashes, peas,
      asparagus, &amp;c., should never be boiled in the same pot, or served up
      in the same dish with bacon, which is too plain a dish for any but a
      country table; while a ham is a delicacy for the city, or for any place.

      BACON AND BEANS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Scrape and trim a nice piece of bacon, (not too fat,) and see that no part
      of it looks yellow or rusty, or shows any appearance of being too old. If
      so, do not cook it, as it is unwholesome, unpalatable, and unfit to eat. A
      shoulder is a good piece to boil. The best of the animal, when smoked, is,
      of course, the ham or leg. We are now speaking of the other pieces that,
      when cured, are properly called bacon, and are eaten at plain tables only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meat, if very salt, is the better for being put in soak early in the
      morning, or the night before. Afterwards put it into a pot, and boil and
      skim it till tender. Have ready a quart or two of fresh green string
      beans, cut into three pieces, (not more); put them into the pot in which
      the bacon is boiling, and let them cook with the meat for an hour or more.
      When done, take them out, drain them well; season them well with pepper,
      and send them to table on a separate dish from the bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons like so well this bacon flavor, that<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> they <i>always</i>, when
      boiling string-beans, put a small piece of bacon in the pot, removing it
      before the beans are sent to table.

    <p>
      With bacon and beans, serve up whole potatos boiled and peeled&mdash;and

      pour it over the potatos, touching each one with pepper.

      Wash and trim a nice piece of bacon; soak it all night, or for several
      hours, in cold water. In the morning scald it with boiling water. Let it
      lie till cool, then throw away the water, and scald it again. Cut it into
      thin slices, very smooth and even; the rind being previously pared off.
      Curl up the slices, rolling them round, and securing them with wooden
      skewers. Broil them on a gridiron, or bake them in a Dutch oven. If cut
      properly thin, they will cook in a quarter of an hour. They must not be
      allowed to burn or blacken. Before you send them to table, take out the
      skewers. They may be cooked in flat slices, without curling, but they must
      be cut always very thin. Slice some hard-boiled eggs, and lay them on the
      meat. Season with black pepper.

    <p>
      <i>Cold</i> boiled ham cooked as above, will require no soaking, and can

      PREPARED LARD.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      As soon as it is cut off from the newly killed pork, put the fat into a
      crock, or deep earthen pot. Cover the crock with its own lid, and let it
      stand all night in a cool place. Next day, cut it into small bits,
      (carefully removing all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251"
      id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> the fleshy particles of lean); and then put
      the fat into a <i>very clean</i> pot, without either water or salt. The
      pot should not be more than half full of pork-fat. Let it boil <i>slowly</i>,
      (stirring it frequently from the bottom, lest it burn,) till it becomes
      quite clear and transparent. Then ladle it into clean pans. When almost
      cold, put it into stoneware jars, which must be closely covered, and kept
      in a cool place. If it is to go to a distance, tie it up in new bladders.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two sorts of pork-fat for lard. The leaf-fat, which is best; and
      the fat that adheres to the entrails. These two fats should be boiled
      separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large entrails, whose skins are to be used for sausages, must be
      cleaned out carefully, well scraped, and thrown into strong salt and water
      for two days, (changing the brine the second day,) and afterwards into
      strong lye for twenty-four hours. Lastly, wash them in fresh water. We
      think it much better to dispense with the skins altogether; keeping your
      sausage meat in jars, and frying it in cakes when wanted for use. Its own
      fat (as it exudes) will cook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never use bad butter when you can obtain good lard, for frying, and other
      purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

    <h2>
      <a name="VENISON" id="VENISON"></a>VENISON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      You may judge of the age of venison by looking at the hoof, which is
      always left on the leg. The deer is young if the cleft of the hoof is
      small and smooth; but large and rough, if he is old. Buck venison is
      considered better than the meat of the doe. The haunch, or hind-quarter,
      is the best part, and the fat upon it should, be thick and white. The
      shoulder, or fore-quarter, is the next best piece. The saddle comprises
      both hind-quarters; and these, for a large company, are always cooked
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      To eat venison in perfection, it should be killed when the deer can find
      plenty of fresh food in the forest, and when they have fattened on the
      abundance of wild berries, which they can obtain during the autumn. In
      winter, they are brought into the cities, lean, hard, dry, and black, and
      the meat infested all through with small threadlike white worms; showing
      that decomposition has commenced, and requiring the disguise of spices,
      wine, currant jelly, &amp;c., to render it <i>eatable</i>, not <i>wholesome</i>,
      for every sort of food in the slightest degree tainted is utterly
      injurious to health, and cannot often be eaten with impunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It never was very fashionable, in America, to eat spoiled victuals, and it
      is now less so than ever. Fortunately, in our land of abundance, "we do
      not see the necessity"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253"

      HAUNCH OF VENISON.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      To prepare a haunch of venison for roasting (we will suppose it to be <i>perfectly</i>
      good and well kept,) wipe it thoroughly all over with clean cloths, dipped
      in lukewarm water, and then go over it with clean dry cloths. Trim off all
      unsightly parts. Lay over the fat a large sheet of thick brown paper, well
      buttered, and securely tied on with twine. Or else make a coarse paste of
      brown meal, and cover it with that. Place it before a good steady fire,
      and let it roast from three to four hours, according to its size. After
      roasting well for three hours, remove the covering of paper or paste, and
      baste the meat well all over; first with dripping or butter, and then with
      its own gravy, dredging it very slightly with browned flour. Skim the fat
      off the gravy, and send the venison to table plain, with sweet sauce of
      black currant jelly, or raspberry jam, in a glass dish with a spoon in it.

      the gravy. Put down the steaks, and when one side is quite done turn the
      other, and broil that. Venison should always be very thoroughly done.
      Before you take up the steaks, lay a bit of nice fresh butter upon each.

      basil; or some boiled onions, minced small, and mixed with chopped sage,

      salt and pepper. Spread the stuffing thickly over the inside of the
      steaks. Then roll them up, and tie them round with packthread, or secure

      Take the remains of cold roast venison, from which sufficient gravy or
      dripping has been saved to cook the meat again, without any water at all.
      It would be well if this were done in all hashes made from cold meat. For
      want of drippings, use butter or lard. Cold meat stewed in water is weak
      and unpalatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three large spoonfuls of mushroom, or tomato catchup, are
      improvements to all hashes. If nothing better can be obtained use onions,
      always previously boiled to render them less strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minced sweet herbs are excellent seasoning for hashes. Also minced
      tarragon leaves; they give a peculiar flavor that is very generally liked.
      Fresh tarragon is in season in July, August, and September.
    </p>

      French mustard (to be obtained at all the best grocery stores) is a great

      Cut steaks from a loin or haunch of venison, which should be as freshly
      killed as you can get it. The strange and absurd prejudice in favor of
      hard black-looking venison, (that has been kept till the juices are all
      dried up,) is fast subsiding; and no one now eats any sort of food in
      which decomposition has commenced. Those who have eaten venison fresh from
      the forest, when the deer have fattened on<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> wild grapes, huckleberries,
      blackberries, cranberries, &amp;c., will never again be able to relish
      such as is brought in wagon loads to the Atlantic cities, and which has
      been kept till full of those fine threads that are in reality long thin
      whitish worms, and which are often seen in very old hams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having removed the bones and cut the meat into steaks, and seasoned it
      with salt and pepper, put the venison into a pot, with merely as much
      water as will cover it well. Let it stew till perfectly tender, skimming
      it occasionally. Then take it out, and set it to cool, saving the gravy in
      a bowl. Make a nice puff paste; divide the paste into two equal portions,
      and roll it out rather thick. Butter a deep dish, and line it with one of
      the sheets of paste, rolled thin at the bottom. Then put in the stewed
      venison. Season the gravy with a glass of <i>very good</i> wine, (either
      port or sherry,) a few blades of mace, and a powdered nutmeg. Stir into it
      the crumbled yolks of some hard-boiled eggs. Pour the gravy over the meat,
      and put on the other sheet of paste, as the lid of the pie. Bring the two
      edges close together, so as to unite evenly, and notch them handsomely.
      Set it immediately into the oven, and bake it well. If a steady heat is
      kept up, it will be done in an hour. Send it to table hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of wine, you may put into the gravy half a pint of <i>black</i>
      currant jelly, which, for venison, is thought preferable to red. Either
      will do.

      VERY PLAIN VENISON PIE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Cut from the bone some good pieces of fine <i>fresh</i> venison, season
      them slightly with salt and pepper, and put them into a pot with plenty of
      potatos, (either sweet or white,) split and quartered, and only as much
      water as will cover the whole. Set it over the fire, cover it, and let it
      stew slowly and steadily, till all is tender, skimming it several times.
      Meanwhile, make a nice paste of flour shortened with cold gravy, or
      drippings saved from roast venison, or of nice lard. Allow half a pint of
      shortening to each quart of flour. Put the flour into a pan, and rub the
      shortening into it as quickly as possible, adding a <i>very little</i>
      cold water, to make it into a lump of paste. Then roll it out into a
      sheet, and spread over it with a broad knife the remaining half of the
      shortening. Dredge lightly with flour, fold it up, and roll it out in two
      sheets. With one of them line your pie-dish, and put into it the stewed
      venison and potatos. Pour in the gravy of the stew. The filling of this
      pie should be piled high in the centre. Lay on, as a lid, the other sheet
      of paste, which should be rather the largest. Pare off smoothly the edges
      of the two crusts, and crimp them nicely. Set the pie in the oven, and
      bake it well. It may be eaten either hot or cold, but is best hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above quantity of paste is only sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> for a very small pie. For
      one of moderate size allow two quarts of flour, and a pound of shortening.

      VENISON POT-PIE.&mdash;

      Remove the bone from some fine venison steaks, cut near an inch thick.
      Season them lightly with pepper and salt, and score them each in several
      places. Stew them in a very little water till tender. Have ready an ample
      portion of nice suet paste. If you cannot obtain beef suet use cold
      venison fat, minced fine and made into a paste with double its quantity in
      flour, and as little water as possible. Lay some stewed venison at the
      bottom of the pot, and line the sides with paste almost up to the top. Put
      in the meat, adding among it boiled sweet potatos cut into pieces, or (if
      they are to be had in plenty,) chestnuts, boiled and peeled. Mushrooms
      will be a great improvement. Onion also, (if liked,) boiled and cut up.
      Intersperse the whole with square pieces of paste. Fill the pot almost to
      the top with the meat and other ingredients. Lay a thick paste over the
      whole, cut round to fit, but not too closely. Pour in a pint of warm water
      to increase the gravy. Make a cross slit in the middle of the upper crust.
      Cook the pie till all is well done. Serve it up with the brown crust in
      pieces, and laid on the top.

      pound of coarse brown sugar, and a pound of salt. Let them be very

      rubbing hard till it froths. Keep the meat in the pickle for two weeks,
      turning it every day. Then take it out, and roll it in saw-dust, (which,
      on no account, must be the saw-dust of any species of pine.) Hang it for
      two weeks longer in the smoke of oak wood or of corn cobs. All hams, when
      being smoked, must be hung very high, and have the large end downwards. If
      hung too low, the heat softens or melts the fat.

      Venison hams, if well cured, require no boiling. They are always eaten

      RABBITS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Rabbits should be young and tender, but full-grown and fat. Two are
      required to make a dish. One rabbit, except for an invalid, is scarcely
      worth the trouble of cooking; and, being naturally insipid, it must have
      certain seasoning to make it taste well. The hare, so much prized in
      England, owes its reputation entirely to their mode of dressing it, which
      is troublesome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
      expensive, and in our country would never become popular, unless the
      animal had in itself more to recommend it. With all that can be done for a
      hare, it is, when cooked, black, dry, hard; and if it has been kept long
      enough to acquire what they call the "true game flavor," so much the
      worse. A fine fat well-fed tame rabbit is much better. In Virginia, the
      negroes frequently call a large rabbit "a hare"&mdash;or rather "a yar;"
      and though they know it to be young, they generally term it "that old
      yar." We opine that <i>with them</i> "yars" are not admired. If a rabbit
      is really old his ears are tough, and his claws blunt and rough with
      coarse hairs growing between them. A young rabbit has short sharp claws,
      and ears so tender that on trying you can easily tear them. Rabbits should
      be cooked the day they are killed. Always cut off the head. A rabbit
      dished whole, with its head on, is, to most persons, a disgusting sight.
      The head of no small animal is worth eating, and always looks disagreeable
      when cooked.

      The livers of rabbits should be added to the gravy.

      Take a pair of fine well-fed young rabbits, and having drawn or emptied
      them, lay them, for about ten minutes, in a pan of warm water. Then dry
      them inside with a clean cloth, carefully wiping them out. Truss them

      Make a plentiful stuffing or forcemeat of bread steeped in milk, some
      fresh butter mixed with a very little flour; or, instead of butter, some
      beef suet finely minced; some chopped sweet herbs; and some crumbled yolks
      of hard-boiled eggs. Season with mace and nutmeg, and grated lemon rind.
      Fill the rabbits well with this&mdash;or, you may stuff them entirely with
      boiled potatos, mashed with plenty of nice butter, or the drippings of
      roast veal or pork. Or (if liked) you may make the stuffing entirely of
      minced onion, (previously boiled,) and minced sage leaves, moistened with
      a very little lard or sweet oil, and seasoned with powdered mace, nutmeg,
      and pepper. Having put in plenty of stuffing, sew up the bodies of the
      rabbits, flour them well, and put them on the spit and set them before a
      clear fire. Baste them with milk, or with fresh butter, tied up in thin
      muslin. They will be done in an hour or more. Thicken the gravy with
      flour, and pour it over them in the dish. Roasted rabbits make a good

      A COATED HARE, OR LARGE RABBIT.&mdash;

      The hare, or rabbit, should be large and fat. Save the liver and heart to

      good fresh beef, seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, stewed in a small
      sauce-pan, till all the essence is extracted, adding the chopped liver and
      heart, and a bit of fresh butter, rolled in flour. Cold fresh meat, or
      meat that has to be recooked, is unfit for gravy, and so it is for soup.
      Line the inside of the hare with small thin slices of fat ham, or bacon,

      grated yellow rind and juice of a lemon, or orange, a piece of fresh
      butter, some minced sweet marjoram, and the crumbled yolk of one or two
      hard-boiled eggs. Season the stuffing with a little pepper and salt, and
      some powdered nutmeg and mace. Fill the body of the hare with this
      mixture, and sew it up, to keep in the stuffing. Spit the hare, and roast
      it well, keeping it for a while at a moderate distance from the fire. To
      baste it, while roasting, make a dressing of the beaten yolks of four
      eggs, four spoonfuls of flour, a pint of milk, and three table-spoonfuls
      of salad oil, all well-beaten together. Baste the hare with this till it
      is thickly coated all over with the batter, taking care it does not burn.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Spring chickens bring a high price, and are considered delicacies, but
      they are so insipid, and have so little on them, that we think the
      purchase of them, when very young, a mere fashionable extravagance, and a
      waste of money that might be better employed in something that had really
      a fine flavor, and that when divided was more than a morsel for each
      person. We wonder that any but invalids should care for spring chickens.
      It is better to wait till the young chickens grow into nice plump fowls,
      that were well fed, and have lived long enough to show it. A fine
      full-grown young fowl, has a clear white skin, that tears easily when
      tried with a pin. It has a broad fleshy breast, the legs are smooth, and
      the toes easily broken when bent back. Fowls with whitish legs are
      considered the best for boiling; those with dark legs the best for
      roasting. The finest of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266"
      id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> fowls are capons. They grow very large and
      fat, and yet are as tender as young chickens, have a fine delicate rich
      flavor of their own, and are well worth their cost. The great Bucks county
      fowls are profitable because they are large; but they are never very
      plenty in market, being difficult to raise. The best poultry feels heavy
      in proportion to its size. Hen turkeys are best for boiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ducks and geese (particularly the latter) are so tough when old, that it
      is often impossible to eat them; therefore buy none that are not young.
      Geese are generally kept alive too long, for the sake of their feathers,
      which they always shed in August, and for which there is always a demand.
      And geese are not expensive to keep, as in summer they feed on grass, and
      will graze in a field like sheep. The feet and legs of an old goose are
      red and hard. So is her bill. The skin is rough, coarse, and tough, and
      full of hairs. Let nothing induce you to buy an old goose. You would find
      it too tough to carve, and too tough to eat. And no cooking can make her
      tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poultry should be drawn, or emptied (taking care not to break the gall) as
      soon almost as killed. Then let it be well washed, inside and out, and
      wiped dry. In picking it, carefully remove every plug or vestige of
      feathers, and singe off the hairs, by holding the bird to the fire, with a
      lighted piece of writing paper. Brown paper will give it something of an
      unpleasant taste. Newspaper is worse, on account of the printing-ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      If poultry is brought from market frozen, you<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> need not hasten to thaw it,
      before it is actually wanted for use. Till then, put it in a cold place,
      and let it remain frozen. It will keep the better. When you thaw it, by
      all means use only <i>cold</i> water. Any frozen poultry, or meat, thawed
      in warm water, will most certainly spoil. Let it be remembered that any
      food which has been frozen requires a much longer time to cook.

      BOILED TURKEY.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      For boiling, choose a fine fat hen turkey. In drawing it, be careful not
      to break the gall, or a bitter taste will be communicated to the whole
      bird. In picking, remove every plug and hair, and then singe it with <i>writing-paper</i>.
      Wash it very clean, and then wipe it dry, inside and out. In trussing,
      draw the legs into the body, having cut them off at the first joint. Let
      the turkey look as round and plump as possible. Fill the breast with a
      very nice forcemeat, or stuffing, made of a quarter of a pound of grated
      bread-crumbs, mixed with two large table-spoonfuls or two ounces of fresh
      butter, or finely minced suet, seasoned with a little pepper and salt, a
      heaped tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg and mace mixed together, a
      table-spoonful of sweet herbs<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> (sweet basil and sweet
      marjoram) chopped small if green, and powdered if dry; and the crumbled
      yolks of two hard-boiled eggs. Add the grated yellow rind,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> and the
      juice of a fresh lemon, and mix the whole very well. Skewer the liver and
      gizzard under the pinions, having first cut open the gizzard and cleared
      it of sand or gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no longer customary to mix stuffing or forcemeat with beaten raw egg
      for the purpose of binding the ingredients together. Leave them loose,
      without this binding, and the forcemeat will be much lighter, better
      flavored, and more abundant. It will not fall out if a packthread, or very
      <i>small</i> twine is wound carefully round the body, (to be removed
      before serving up,) and it may be secured by sewing it with a needle and
      thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put the turkey into a large pot with plenty of cold water, and boil it
      gently, for two hours or more, in proportion to its size; carefully
      removing all the scum as it rises. It will be whiter if boiled in a large
      clean cloth, or in a coarse paste, (the paste to be thrown away
      afterwards,) and take care that it is thoroughly done. Serve up boiled
      turkey with oyster sauce, celery sauce, or cauliflower sauce. Sweet sauce
      is rarely eaten with boiled things&mdash;unless with puddings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boiled turkey should be accompanied by a ham or tongue.
    </p>

      To ascertain if boiled poultry is done, try the thickest parts with a
      large needle. If the needle goes through, and in and out easily, it is
      sufficient.

      A turkey (boiled or roast) for a family dish, may be stuffed with nice
      sausage meat, in which case it requires no other stuffing. Surround it on
      a dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
      with fried sausage cakes, about the size of a dollar, but near an inch
      thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very convenient to keep always in the house, during the winter
      months, one or two large jars of nice home-made sausage-meat, well
      covered. The best time for making sausage-meat is in November. After
      March, sausages are seldom eaten.

      OYSTER TURKEY.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      (<i>French dish.</i>)&mdash;Prepare a fine young hen turkey, for boiling;
      skewering the liver and gizzard under the pinions. Fill the body well with
      fine large fresh oysters, having removed their hard part or gristle. Add
      to the oysters a tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg and mace, and a
      tea-spoonful of celery seed or minced celery, and a piece of fresh butter
      dredged with flour. With this, stuff the turkey very full; securing the
      stuffing with packthread. Put the turkey into a large block-tin kettle,
      and let it stew in the oyster liquor only, without any water. Strain the
      oyster liquor before you put it in. Set the kettle into an outer kettle
      full of boiling water. This will cook the turkey very nicely. For such
      purposes, nothing is so convenient as the utensil called in French a <i>bain
      marie</i>, (pronounced <i>bine marée</i>.) This is a permanent double
      kettle with two covers, and a large tube or spout outside, for pouring in
      fresh hot water, without opening the lid and letting out the steam. They
      are to be had of all sizes at the furnishing stores in New York and
      Philadel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>phia,
      and are so excellent for stewing without water, that no family should be
      without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the turkey is well boiled and quite done, keep it warm by wrapping it
      closely in a cloth, putting a dish cover over it, and placing it near the
      fire. A fine oyster gravy will be found in the kettle. Add to it some
      fresh butter, dredged with flour, and some mace and nutmeg, and some
      celery seed. Give it one boil up, and send it to table as sauce for the
      turkey. This is a very nice way of cooking a small turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of oyster chickens may be thus prepared, and stewed in the above
      manner in a <i>bain marie</i>, or double kettle.

      ROAST TURKEY.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take a fine large turkey, full-grown and fat, draw and singe him
      carefully, saving the giblets (neck, heart, gizzard, and liver,) for the
      gravy. After he is drawn, wash the inside well, wipe it dry, and sprinkle
      it with black pepper. Make a large quantity of stuffing or forcemeat. It
      increases his apparent size, and besides is generally liked. Mince small
      some cold boiled ham, in equal portions of fat and lean: grated lemon
      rind, minced sweet herbs, fresh butter, or finely minced suet. Add plenty
      of grated bread-crumbs or crumbled rusk; also, hard-boiled yolk of egg
      crumbled. Moisten the mixture with lemon juice and some good white wine.
      Stuff the turkey well with this forcemeat, sewing it up, or winding a
      small cord round the body to secure the filling.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> Roast it before a clear and
      substantial fire, basting it well with fresh butter. When done, take it up
      and keep it hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cut up the giblets and put them into a small sauce-pan, with a very little
      water, and stew them while the turkey is roasting; adding a piece of fresh
      butter dredged with flour. When done, remove the pieces of neck, &amp;c.,
      retaining those of the heart, liver, and gizzard. Stir into the gravy,
      after it comes from the fire, the yolk of a beaten egg. Having skimmed the
      gravy in the dripping-pan, add it to the gravy that has been made of the
      giblets, and send it to table in a sauce-boat. Accompany the turkey with
      an oval dish, or tureen of cranberry sauce, made very sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A roast turkey may be stuffed with oysters, or with chestnuts boiled,
      peeled, and mashed with butter. If with chestnuts, thicken the gravy with
      whole boiled chestnuts. If with oysters, send oyster-sauce to table with
      the turkey. If chestnuts cannot be obtained, any roasted poultry is good
      stuffed with well-boiled sweet potatos, mashed with plenty of butter or
      meat drippings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legs of turkeys are never helped to any one at table. They are always
      sent away on the dish.

      A BONED TURKEY.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      For this purpose you must have a fine, large, tender turkey; and after it
      is drawn, and washed, and wiped dry, lay it on a clean table, and take a
      very sharp knife, with a narrow blade and point. Begin at the neck; then<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> go round
      to the shoulders and wings, and carefully separate the flesh from the
      bone, scraping it down as you proceed. Next loosen the flesh from the
      breast, and back, and body; and then from the thighs. It requires care and
      patience to do it nicely, and to avoid tearing or breaking the skin. The
      knife should always penetrate quite to the bone; scraping loose the flesh
      rather than cutting it. When all the flesh has been completely loosened,
      take the turkey by the neck, give it a pull, and the whole skeleton will
      come out entirely from the flesh, as easily as you draw your hand out of a
      glove. The flesh will then fall down, a flat and shapeless mass. With a
      small needle and thread, carefully sew up any holes that have accidentally
      been torn in the skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have ready a large quantity of stuffing, made as follows:&mdash;Take three
      sixpenny loaves of stale bread; grate the crumb; and put the crust in
      water to soak. When quite soft, break them up small into the pan of grated
      bread-crumbs, and mix in a pound of fresh butter, cut into little pieces.
      Take two large bunches of sweet marjoram; the same of sweet basil; and one
      bunch of parsley. Mince the parsley very fine, and rub to a powder the
      leaves of the marjoram and basil. You should have two large heaping
      table-spoonfuls of each. Chop, also, two very small onions or shalots, and
      mix them with the herbs. Pound to powder a quarter of an ounce of mace;
      and two large nutmegs. Mix the spices together, and add a tea-spoonful of
      salt, and a tea-spoonful of ground black pepper. Then mix<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> the
      herbs, spices, &amp;c., thoroughly into the bread-crumbs, and add, by
      degrees, four hard-boiled eggs crumbled fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take up a handful of this filling; squeeze it hard, and proceed to stuff
      the turkey with it&mdash;beginning at the wings; next do the body; and
      then the thighs. Stuff it very hard; and, as you proceed, form the turkey
      into its natural shape, by filling out, properly, the wings, breast, body,
      &amp;c. When all the stuffing is in, sew up the body and skewer the turkey
      into the usual shape in which they are trussed; so that, if skillfully
      done, it will look almost as if it had not been boned. Tie it round with
      tape, and bake it three hours or more; basting it occasionally with fresh
      butter. Make a gravy of the giblets, chopped, and stewed slowly in a
      little water. When done, add to it the gravy that is in the dish about the
      turkey, (having first skimmed off the fat,) and enrich it with a glass of
      white wine, and two beaten yolks of eggs, stirred in just before you take
      it from the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the turkey is to be eaten cold at the supper-table, drop
      table-spoonfuls of currant or cranberry jelly all over it at small
      distances, and in the dish round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very handsome way of serving it up cold is, after making a sufficiency
      of nice clear calves'-foot jelly, (seasoned, as usual, with wine, lemon,
      cinnamon, &amp;c.,) to lay the turkey in the dish in which it is to go to
      table, and setting it under the jelly-bag, let the jelly drip upon it, so
      as to form a transparent coating all over it; smoothing the jelly<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> evenly
      with the back of a spoon, as it congeals on the turkey. Apple jelly may be
      substituted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large fowls may be boned and stuffed in the above manner: also, a young
      roasting pig.

      ROAST GOOSE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      A goose for roasting should be young, tender, and fat; so tender, that the
      skin can easily be torn by a pin; the bill and legs smooth and of a light
      yellow color, and the toes breaking when bent under. If the skin is thick
      and tough, and the bill and legs a dark reddish yellow, rough and hairy,
      do not buy the goose. It is old, and no cooking can make it eatable. A
      goose, from its profusion of feathers, looks like a large bird when
      walking about; but when plucked and prepared for the spit, it will be
      found very deceptive. It is much more hollow than a turkey; and, except
      the breast, there is but little eating on it. In large families it is
      usual to have a pair of roast geese, one not being sufficient. Geese are
      not good except for roasting, or in a pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      In preparing a goose for cooking, save the giblets for the gravy. After
      the goose has been drawn, singed well, washed and wiped, inside and out;
      trussed so as to look round and short; make a quantity of stuffing, (as
      its hollow body will require a great deal.) For this purpose, parboil two
      good sized onions, and a large bunch of green sage. Mince both the sage
      and onions, seasoning them with a small salt-spoon of salt, half as much
      black pepper, and still less cayenne. Add a hard-boiled<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> egg
      finely minced (yolk and white;) the chopped egg giving a nice smoothness
      to the sage and onion. If your goose is large, take two chopped eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the stuffing very mild, (if preferred so,) add a handful of finely
      grated bread-crumbs; or two or three fine juicy chopped apples. Fill the
      body and craw with this stuffing, and secure it with a needle and thread
      from falling out. Set the goose before a clear, steady fire&mdash;having a
      little warm water in the dripping-pan to baste it till the gravy begins to
      fall. Keep it well basted all the time it is roasting. It must be
      thoroughly done all through. Roast it according to its size, from an hour
      and a half to two hours or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boil the giblets in a sauce-pan by themselves, seasoned with a little salt
      and pepper, and having among them a bit of butter dredged with flour. When
      done, remove the neck, and retain the heart, liver, and gizzard, cut into
      pieces, and served in the gravy, which should be well skimmed. Also, skim
      carefully the fat off the gravy in the bottom of the dripping-pan. Put the
      two gravies together, and serve them up in a gravy tureen. To eat with the
      goose, have plenty of apple-sauce, made of fine juicy apples, stewed very
      dry, well sweetened, and flavored with the grated yellow rind and juice of
      a lemon; or with some rose-water and nutmeg stirred in after the sauce is
      taken from the fire. Rose-water evaporates in cooking, and should never
      boil or be kept on the fire. A <i>bain marie</i>, or double kettle, is
      excellent for stewing fruit; putting the fruit inside, and the water
      outside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      For a family dinner a goose is very good stuffed with well-boiled potatos,
      mashed smooth, with plenty of fresh butter or gravy. Sweet potatos make an
      excellent stuffing. So do boiled chestnuts, mashed with butter or gravy.

      GOOSE PIE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The old fashioned goose pie made with a standing crust, (the flour being
      mixed with boiling water, and therefore unfit for eating,) is now
      obsolete. They were generally sent as Christmas presents. Besides the
      goose, they contained chickens, pigeons, (all boned,) and various other
      things. They had standing sides like an oval wall, covered with a lid of
      the same paste, having, on the top, a knob, by which to lift off. These
      pies were expected to remain good a week; but generally the gravy became
      sour in a few days, even in winter, and however carefully kept from the
      air. The following is a receipt to make a fine goose pie for immediate
      use, and with a nice eatable paste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a fine plump young goose, and parboil it, (in as little water as will
      cover it,) saving the gravy. Having removed the skin, cut all the flesh
      from the bones. Make a nice light short paste, allowing a large half pound
      of fresh butter to each quart of flour. For a goose pie you will require
      two quarts of flour and one pound of butter. Line a deep pie-dish with one
      sheet of paste, reserving the other sheet for the lid, which should be
      rolled out thick. Put in the pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> goose, seasoned with pepper
      only, interspersing among it the best part of a smoked tongue, cut in
      thick round slices. Make a nice forcemeat into balls, about the size of a
      hickory nut, and add them to the filling of the pie; and some chestnuts
      boiled and peeled; or some round slices of boiled sweet potato. Having
      made a gravy of the giblets stewed, pour that over the other ingredients,
      filling the pie well, and heaping it high in the middle. Add a few bits of
      fresh butter dredged in flour. Pour in the gravy, and lay on the top the
      lid of the pie rolled out thick, ornamenting the edges handsomely. Cut a
      cross slit in the top, and fit into it a flower, or tulip cut out of
      paste. This pie is for dinner company, and to be eaten warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may make a similar pie of a pair of fine ducks, either tame or wild.
      Canvas-backs and red necks are excellent for this purpose. To eat with it,
      have mashed potato, browned all over with a salamander.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the shores of our southern rivers, where canvas-backs and other fine
      wild ducks are abundant, a pie affords an agreeable variety to the usual
      modes of cooking them.

      a very little water; cover the pan closely, and let<span class="pagenum"><a

      are tender. Then take them out, and save all the gravy; having strained it
      from the seasoning articles. Make a rich paste, and roll it out into two
      sheets. With one sheet cover the bottom and sides of a deep dish. Put in
      the giblets&mdash;mixing among them a few raw potatos sliced very thin,
      the chopped yolks of some hard-boiled eggs, and some bits of butter rolled

      sage and onion, as for a goose. In case some of the company should have a
      dislike to onion, fill the other duck with a forcemeat of bread-crumbs,
      sweet herbs, &amp;c., as for turkey. Place them before a quick fire, but
      not so near as to scorch. Roast them well, basting them all the time. Skim

      Venison or lamb cutlets may be fricasseed in this manner. Likewise, tame

      TO STEW CANVAS-BACK DUCKS.&mdash;

      Put the giblets into a sauce-pan with a very little water, and a piece of
      butter rolled in flour, and a very little salt and cayenne. Let them stew
      gently to make a gravy, keeping the sauce-pan covered. In the mean time,
      half roast the ducks, saving the gravy that falls from them. Then cut them
      up, put them into a large stew-pan, with the gravy (having first skimmed
      off the fat,) and merely water enough to keep them from burning. Set the
      pan over a moderate fire, and let them stew gently till done. Towards the
      last, (having removed the giblets) pour over the ducks the gravy from the
      small sauce-pan, and stir in a large glass of port wine, and a glass of

    </p>
    <p>
      Any ducks may be stewed as above. The common wild duck, teal, &amp;c.,
      should always be parboiled with a large carrot in the body to extract the
      fishy or sedgy taste. On tasting this carrot before it is thrown away, it
      will be found to have imbibed strongly that disagreeable flavor.

      BROILED CANVAS-BACK DUCKS.&mdash;

      To eat these ducks with their flavor and juices in perfection, they should
      be cooked immediately after killing. If shot early in the morning, they
      will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
      be found delicious, if broiled for breakfast. If killed in the forenoon,
      let them be on that day's dinner table. When they can be obtained quite
      fresh they want nothing to improve the flavor. Neither do red-necks, or
      the other water fowl that are found in such abundance on the shores of the
      Chesapeake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the ducks have been plucked, singed, drawn, and washed, split
      them down the back, (their heads, necks, and legs having been cut off,)
      rub with chalk the bars of a very clean gridiron, and set it over a bed of
      bright lively wood-coals. This gridiron (and all others) should have
      grooved bars, so as to save as much of the gravy as possible. Broil the
      ducks well and thoroughly, turning them on both sides. They will generally
      be done in half an hour. Dish them in their own gravy. The flesh should
      have no redness about it when dished. To half broil them on the gridiron,
      and to finish the cooking on a hot plate, set over a heater on the table,
      renders the ducks tough, and deadens the natural taste, for which no
      made-up sauce can atone. You may lay a few bits of nice butter on them
      after they are dished.

      Stuff two fowls with a nice forcemeat, made in the best manner, or with
      good sausage meat, if in haste. Another nice stuffing for roast fowls is
      boiled chestnuts, stewed in butter, or in nice drippings. Mushrooms cut up
      and stewed in a very little butter, make a fine stuffing for roasted
      fowls. Secure the stuffing from falling out by winding a twine or tape
      round the body of the fowl, or sewing it. Roast the fowls before a very
      clear fire, basting them with butter. When the fowls are done, set them
      away to be kept warm, while you finish the gravy, having saved the heart,
      gizzard, and liver, to enrich it. Skim it well from the fat and thicken it
      with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
      very little browned flour. Send it to table in a sauce-boat. Serve up with
      roast fowls, dried peach sauce, or cranberry. Make all fruit sauces very
      thick and sweet. If watery and sour, they seem poor and mean.

      Full-grown fowls require, (at least,) an hour for roasting. If very large,

      Nothing can be done with old tough fowls but to boil them in soup, till

      Take a fine plump pair of young (but full-grown) fowls, and prepare them
      for boiling. Those with white or light yellow legs are considered the
      best. Make a nice forcemeat stuffing, and fill their bodies with it, and
      fasten the livers and gizzards under the pinions. For boiled poultry they
      are not wanted in the gravy. Having trussed the fowls, and picked and
      singed them carefully, put them into a large pot containing equal
      quantities of boiling water and cold water. This will make it lukewarm.
      Let them boil steadily for an hour after the simmering has commenced,
      carefully removing the scum.

    <p>
      For boiled fowls, you may make a nice stuffing of fresh oysters, cut in
      small pieces, but not minced. Omit the gristle. Mix them with an equal
      portion of hard-boiled eggs chopped, but not minced fine. Add plenty of
      grated bread-crumbs, and season with powdered mace. Mix in, also, some
      bits of fresh butter. Where onions are liked, you may substitute for the
      oysters some onions boiled and minced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fowls boil very nicely in a <i>bain marie</i>, or double kettle, with the
      water outside. They require a longer time, but are excellent when done. To
      quicken the boiling of a double kettle, put a handful of salt in the

      and therefore it is often difficult to get more than two or three small
      mouthfuls of flesh off their bones. On the contrary, poor chickens are not
      worth broiling or cooking in any way. To have broiled chickens good,
      choose those that are fat and fleshy. Having cleaned them well, and washed
      them, and wiped them dry, split and divide them into four quarters;
      flattening the bones with a steak mallet. They will be much improved by
      stewing or boiling in a little water for ten minutes. Then draining them
      and saving the liquor for gravy. Boil in this the neck, feet, heart,
      gizzard and liver. Strain it after boiling, and save the liver to mash
      into the gravy. Season the gravy with grated carrot and minced parsley, or
      sweet marjoram, and a little cayenne, adding a small piece of fresh butter
      dredged in flour. Have ready plenty of fine bread-crumbs, seasoned with
      nutmeg, and in another pan four yolks of eggs well beaten. The quarters of
      the chickens having become quite cold, dip each one first into the egg,
      and then into the crumbs. Set the gridiron over a clear fire, and broil
      the chicken well, first laying down the inside. Having prepared the gravy
      as above, give it a short boil, then send it to table in a sauce-boat with
      the chickens.

      CHICKEN GUMBO.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Cut up a young fowl as if for a fricassee. Put into a stew-pan a large
      table-spoonful of fresh butter, mixed with a tea-spoonful of flour, and an
      onion finely minced. Brown them over the fire, and then add a quart of
      water, and the pieces of chicken, with a large quarter of a<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span> peck of
      ochras, (first sliced thin, and then chopped,) and a salt-spoon of salt.
      Cover the pan, and let the whole stew together, till the ochras are
      entirely dissolved, and the fowl thoroughly done. If it is a very young
      chicken, do not put it in at first; as half an hour will be sufficient to
      cook it. Serve it up hot in a deep dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may add to the ochras an equal quantity of tomatos cut small. If you
      use tomatos, no water will be necessary, as their juice will supply a
      sufficient liquid.

      class="fnanchor">[D]</a> FILET GUMBO.&mdash;Cut up a pair of fine plump
      fowls into pieces, as when carving. Lay them in a pan of cold water, till
      all the blood is drawn out. Put into a pot, two large table-spoonfuls of
      lard, and set it over the fire. When the lard has come to a boil, put in
      the chickens with an onion finely minced. Dredge them well with flour, and
      season slightly with salt and pepper; and, if you like it, a little
      chopped marjoram. Pour on it two quarts of boiling water. Cover it, and
      let it simmer slowly for three hours. Then stir into it two heaped
      tea-spoonfuls of sassafras powder. Afterwards, let it stew five or six
      minutes longer, and then send it to table in a deep dish; having a dish of
      boiled rice to be eaten with it by those who like rice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gumbo will be much improved by stewing with it three or four thin
      slices of cold boiled ham, in which case omit the salt in the seasoning.
      When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>ever
      cold ham is an ingredient in any dish, no other salt is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen fresh oysters and their liquor, added to the stew about half an
      hour before it is taken up, will also be an improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot conveniently obtain sassafras-powder, stir the gumbo
      frequently with a stick of sassafras root.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a genuine southern receipt. Filet gumbo may be made of any sort of
      poultry, or of veal, lamb, venison, or kid.

      moisten it. Mince very fine, six table-spoonfuls of the white part of cold

      of tarragon or parsley; add a grated nutmeg, and the yellow rind of a

      Cut up and parboil a pair of large fowls, seasoning them with pepper,
      salt, and nutmeg. You may add some small slices of cold ham; in which case
      use <i>no salt</i>, as the ham will make it salt enough. Or you may put in
      some pieces of the lean of fresh pork. You may prepare a suet-paste; but
      for a chicken pot-pie it is best to make the paste of butter, which should
      be fresh, and of the best quality. Allow to each quart of flour, a small
      half-pound of butter. There should be enough for a great deal of paste.
      Line the sides of the pot, two-thirds up, with paste. Put in the chickens,
      with the liquor in which they were parboiled. You may add some sliced
      potatos. Intersperse the pieces of chicken with layers of paste in square
      slices. Then cover the whole with a lid of paste, not fitting very
      closely. Make a cross-slit in the top, and boil the pie about an hour or
      more.

      Instead of ham, you may add some clams to the chicken, omitting salt in

      also, four table-spoonfuls of grated cocoa-nut. Mix all well in the
      stew-pan, and then put in the pieces of chicken. Cover the pan, and let
      all stew moderately for half an hour, stirring it round occasionally; and,
      if getting too dry, add a little hot water. Also, towards the last, the
      grated yellow rind of a lemon and the juice. It should stew till the
      chicken is quite tender, and till the flesh parts easily from the bones.
      Serve it up hot, in a covered dish, and send half a pound of boiled rice
      in a separate dish, <i>uncovered</i>. This is a dish for company.

      COUNTRY CAPTAIN.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is an East India dish, and a very easy preparation of curry. The term
      "country captain," signifies a captain of the native troops, (or Sepoys,)
      in the pay of England; their own country being India, they are there
      called generally the country troops. Probably this dish was first
      introduced at English tables by a Sepoy officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having well boiled a fine full-grown fowl, cut it up as for carving. Have
      ready two large onions boiled and sliced. Season the pieces of chicken
      with curry powder or turmeric; rubbed well into them, all over. Fry them
      with the onion, in plenty of lard or fresh butter, and when well-browned
      they are done enough. Take them up with a perforated skimmer, and drain
      through its holes. It will be a great improvement to put in, at the
      beginning, three or four table-spoonfuls of finely grated cocoa-nut. This
      will be found an advantage to any curry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serve up, in another dish, a pint of rice, well<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> picked, and washed clean in
      two or three cold waters. Boil the rice in plenty of water, (leaving the
      skillet or sauce-pan uncovered;) and when it is done, drain it very dry,
      and set it on a dish before the fire, tossing it up with two forks, one in
      each hand, so as to separate all the grains, leaving each one to stand for
      itself. All rice for the dinner table should be cooked in this manner.
      Persons accustomed to rice never eat it watery or clammy, or lying in a
      moist mass. Rice should never be covered, either while boiling, or when
      dished.

      PARTRIDGES PEAR FASHION&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      (<i>French dish.</i>)&mdash;Your partridges should be fine and fat, and of
      the same size. For a large dish have three or four. Truss them tight and
      round, and rub over them a little salt and cayenne, mixed. Cut off one of
      the legs and leave the other on, fill them with a nice forcemeat. Make a
      rich paste of flour, butter, and beaten egg, using as little water as
      possible. Be sure to make enough of paste to cover each partridge entirely
      over, and roll it out evenly, and rather thick than thin. Put a sufficient
      portion of paste nicely round each partridge, pressing it closely and
      smoothly with your hand, and forming it into the shape of a large pear.
      Leave one leg sticking out at the top to resemble the stem, having cut off
      the foot. Set them in a pan, and bake them in a dutch oven. In the mean
      time, make in a small sauce-pan, a rich brown gravy of the livers, and
      other trimmings of the partridges, and some drippings of roast veal or
      roasted poultry. It will be better still if you reserve one or two small
      partridges to cut up, and stew for the gravy. Season it with a little salt
      and cayenne. When it has boiled long enough to be very thick and rich,
      take it off, strain it, and put the liquid into a clean sauce-pan. Add the
      juice of a large orange, made very sweet with powdered white sugar. Set it
      over the fire, and when it comes to a boil, stir in the beaten yolks of
      two eggs. Let it boil two or three minutes longer; then take it off, and
      keep it hot till the partridges and their paste are thoroughly well baked.
      When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
      done, stand up the partridges in a deep dish, and serve up the gravy in a

      of fresh butter, and spread over it two ounces of vermicelli. Then line
      the dish with puff-paste. Have ready some birds seasoned with powdered
      nutmeg, and a very little salt and pepper. Place them with the breast
      downward. They will be much improved by putting into each a mushroom or an
      oyster chopped fine. Lay them on the paste.<span class="pagenum"><a

      veal, (cold gravy saved from veal roasted the preceding day will do very
      well,) and cover the pie with a lid of puff-paste. Bake it in a moderate
      oven, and when done, turn it out <i>carefully</i> upon a flat dish, and
      send it to table. The vermicelli, which was originally at the bottom, will
      now be at the top, covering the paste like thatch upon a roof. Trim off
      the edge, so as to look nicely. You may, if you choose, use a larger
      quantity of vermicelli. The yellow sort will be best for this purpose.

      After being well roasted, let it get cold, and then lard it all over the
      breast with lardons or regular slips of fat bacon, put in with a larding

      Be very careful in plucking these to pull out the feathers as carefully
      and handle them as lightly as possible; for the skin is very easily torn
      or broken. Do not draw them, for epicures have decided, that the trail,
      (as they call the intestines,) is the most delicious part of the bird, and
      should by all means be saved for eating. Having wiped the outside
      carefully with a soft cloth, truss them with the head under the wing, and
      the bill laid along upon the breast. Keep the legs bent from the knees,
      retaining that posture by means of a splinter skewer. Suspend the birds to
      a bird-spit, with their feet downward. Melt some fresh butter in the
      dripping-pan, and baste them with it, having first dredged the birds with
      flour. Before the trail begins to drop, (which it will do as soon as they
      are well heated,) lay a thick round of very nice<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> toast, (with the crust
      pared off,) buttered on both sides, and placed in the dripping-pan
      beneath, so as to catch the trail as it falls; allowing a slice of toast
      to each bird, with the trail spread equally over it. Continue the basting,
      letting the butter fall back from them into the basting spoon. When the
      birds are done, which will be in less than half an hour at a brisk fire&mdash;carefully
      transfer the toasts to a very hot dish; place the birds upon them, and
      pour some gravy round the toast.

      PLOVERS.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      This is a very nice bird, with a peculiar and pleasant flavor. They abound
      near our large bays and estuaries in the vicinity of the ocean. There are
      two sorts, the green plover and the gray. Roast them plain; basting them
      only with butter. Or fill them with a forcemeat, and go entirely over the
      outside, first with beaten egg, and then roll each plover in finely grated
      bread-crumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If very fat, stew them plain in butter rolled in flour. Then serve them up

      Reed birds and rice birds are the same. They are very small, (only a

      of fat skewered on the outside, and are sold by the dozen strung on a
      stick like cherries.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cook them, roast them on a bird-spit, basting with their own fat, as it
      drips. A nice way for retaining the whole flavor is to tie each bird
      closely in a vine leaf, and bake them in a dutch oven. Or wrap them in

      ROASTED PIGEONS.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      Take fine fat <i>tame</i> pigeons, and clean and truss them nicely. Four
      pigeons, at least, are requisite to make a dish. Prepare a stuffing or
      forcemeat of finely minced veal, and an equal quantity of cold-boiled ham,
      seasoned with powdered mace and a very little cayenne. Also, two slices of
      bread and butter soaked in as much milk as they will absorb. Fill their

      Wild pigeons are generally too poor to roast. In places where they abound,
      it has been found very profitable to catch them in nets, clip their wings,
      and put them into inclosures, feeding them well with corn so as to make
      them fat. They will then bring as high a price as tame pigeons.

      MELTED BUTTER.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      <i>For Sauces.</i>&mdash;This is frequently called Drawn Butter. For this
      purpose none should be used but fresh butter of the very best quality. It
      is usually sent to table with boiled fish and boiled poultry. Also, with
      boiled mutton, lamb, and veal. It is never served up with any thing
      roasted, fried or broiled. Numerous sauces are made with melted butter. If
      mixed with too much flour and water, and not enough of butter, it will be
      very poor, particularly if the water is in too large proportions. To
      prepare it properly, allow a quarter of a pound of nice butter, to a
      heaped table-spoonful of flour. Mix the butter and flour thoroughly, <i>before</i>
      it goes on the fire. Then add to it four large table-spoonfuls of milk, or
      hot water, well mixed in. Hold it over the fire in a small sauce-pan, kept
      for the purpose. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
      lined with what is called porcelain or enamel is best. Take care there is
      no blaze where the sauce-pan is held. Cover it, and shake it over the fire
      till it boils. Then having skimmed it, add three or four hard-boiled eggs
      chopped small, and give it one more boil up; or season it with any other
      ingredient with which you wish to distinguish the sauce.

      For this purpose use none but the very best fresh butter, such as is made
      in summer, when the cows are well pastured. Cut up the butter, put it into
      an enameled or porcelain stew-pan, and melt it gently over a clear and
      moderate fire. When it simmers, skim it thoroughly, draw it from the fire,
      and let it stand five minutes, that the milk or sediment may sink to the
      bottom. Then pour it clear from the sediment through a muslin strainer, or
      a fine clean hair sieve. Transfer to jars with close covers, and keep them
      in a cool dry place. If well prepared, and originally very good, this
      butter will answer for sauces, stews, &amp;c., and continue good a long
      time. In France, where they do not <i>salt</i> any butter, large
      quantities are melted in this way for winter use.

      will communicate a beautiful pink color, which you may heighten, by
      pressing the bag a little. When done, take out the bag, and stir the
      alkanet color evenly through the sauce. The alkanet has no taste, and is
      very cheap. Beet juice will color a tolerable red.

    <p>
      <i>For Green Sauce.</i>&mdash;Pound some fresh spinach leaves, till you

    <p>
      <i>For Yellow Sauce.</i>&mdash;Tie up a very little turmeric powder in a

      settle a few minutes; then pour it off from the sediment at the bottom.
      Wash the sauce-pan or get another clean one. Return the melted butter to
      it, and set it again over the fire. Then dredge in gradually sufficient
      sifted flour to make it very thick and smooth, stirring it well after each
      addition of flour. Do not allow it to brown in the slightest degree, but
      keep it perfectly white to the last; simmering, but not actually boiling,

      fine fresh butter; and, having stirred them well together, put them into a
      sauce-pan over the fire, and simmer till it begins to froth; then diminish

      color.

    <p>
      Another browning is mushroom catchup, or walnut catchup. They communicate

      Take a pint of the liquor of <i>fresh</i> oysters, and strain it into a

      pint of milk instead of the oyster liquor, seasoning with powdered nutmeg

      has come to a boil, put in the oysters (having removed from each the
      gristle, or hard part.) Let them simmer, but take them from the fire
      without letting them come to a boil, which will shrivel them, and render
      them tough and tasteless. A new fashion is to season oyster sauce with the
      grated yellow rind and juice of a fresh lemon. Others stir in a glass of
      sherry or Madeira. If you use wine or lemon, you must not make the sauce
      with milk, as it will curdle. Use in this case the oyster liquor, if it is

      EGG SAUCE.&mdash;

      Boil four eggs from eight to twelve minutes. Then lay them in a pan of
      fresh water, and let them remain till quite cold. Peel off the shells, and
      take out the eggs. Chop the yolks and whites separately; mix them,
      lightly, into half a pint of melted fresh butter, made in the proportion
      of a quarter of a pound of butter to two large table-spoonfuls of flour,
      and four of milk and hot water. Add some powdered mace, or nutmeg. Egg

      Split and cut up into short slips a bunch of celery, having taken off the

      quarter of a pound of fresh butter that has been well dredged with flour.
      Set it over the fire in a sauce-pan, and add the celery gradually; also
      three or four blades of mace broken up. Boil all slowly together, till the

      MINT SAUCE.&mdash;

      This is only used for roast lamb in the spring. When the lambs are grown

      pleasantly when both are young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a large bunch of fine fresh green mint, that has been washed well.
      Strip the leaves from the stems, and mince them small. Put it into a pint
      bowl, and mix with it gradually some of the best cider vinegar. This sauce
      must not be the least liquid, but as thick as horse-radish sauce or
      thicker. Make it very sweet, with the best brown sugar. Mix it well, and
      transfer to a small tureen, or a little deep dish with a tea-spoon in it.
      Serve it up always with roast lamb, putting a tea-spoonful on the rim of

      as it simmers throw in plenty of nasturtions from the jar. The seeds, when
      gathered, should be full grown, but by no means hard; and the color a fine

      MUSHROOM SAUCE.&mdash;

      Have ready some excellent drawn butter, and thicken it with small button
      mushrooms that have been pickled. Or, take freshly-gathered mushrooms of
      good size, rub off the outer skin with a clean flannel, and cut off the
      stems close to the flaps. Wash the mushrooms in a cullender. Have ready
      some bits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
      fresh butter dredged all over with flour. Lay them among the mushrooms,
      (which, if very large, should be quartered,) and put them into a stew-pan.
      Cover the pan, and let them stew till the mushrooms are all tender. When
      you take off the lid to try them, replace it immediately, keeping in as
      much of the aroma as possible. If fresh, they will yield a great deal of
      juice. When done, transfer them to a sauce-tureen, and serve them up with
      any nice dish of meat or poultry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best mushrooms are found in pure open air or rather high ground, and
      where there is no swamp or woodland. On the upper side of their top they
      are not white, but of a pale grayish tint; the under side is invariably
      light red, pinkish, or pale salmon color, which in a few hours, or after
      being gathered, turns brown. The false mushrooms are poisonous. They are
      entirely white above and below. The fungi that grow in forests or marshes
      can never be mistaken for real mushrooms. They are of various colors,
      chiefly bright yellow and red, and originate in foul air. By boiling a
      silver tea-spoon with your mushrooms, you may test their goodness. If the
      silver turns black, throw the mushrooms away. An onion will also blacken
      from the same cause. Mushrooms should be cooked as soon as possible. If
      kept two or three days, worms will be found in them. Never give mushrooms
      to children. Even in their best state they are not wholesome. The taste
      for mushrooms is an acquired one, and it is best not to acquire it.<span

      scraped horse-radish, and two ounces of minced shalots, or very small
      onions. Put them into a pint of boiling vinegar, in which half an ounce of
      bruised ginger and a quarter of an ounce of mace have been simmered for
      five minutes. Add to this the lemon-juice and the grated peel, and two
      grated nutmegs. Boil all together for half an hour, and then transfer it
      with all the ingredients to a glass jar with a lid. Paste a band of strong
      white paper round the lower part of the lid. Set it in a dry cool place,
      and leave it undisturbed for three months. Then, through a funnel, pour
      off the liquid into small bottles, putting a tea-spoonful of salad oil at
      the top of each. Cork and seal them.

      For a small quantity of this catchup, take twelve fine full-grown
      cucumbers, and lay them an hour in cold water. Then pare them, and grate
      them down into a deep dish. Grate also two small onions, and mix them with
      the grated cucumber. Season the mixture to your taste with pepper, salt,
      and vinegar, making it of the consistence of very thick marmalade or jam.
      When thoroughly amalgamated, transfer it to a glass jar. Cover it closely,
      tying over it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>

      TARRAGON VINEGAR.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The fresh leaves of the tarragon plant are in perfection in July and
      August, and impart a new and pleasant taste to soups, hashes, gravies,
      &amp;c. To use it fresh, wash a bunch of tarragon in cold water.
      Afterwards strip off the green leaves, chop or mince them, and boil a
      tea-spoonful or more in the dish you intend<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> to flavor. The best way of
      keeping tarragon is to strip off as many fresh leaves as will half fill a
      glass jar that holds a quart. Pour on as much <i>real</i> cider vinegar as
      will fill up the jar. Cover it closely, and let the tarragon infuse in it
      for a week, shaking the jar every day. Then pour off that vinegar
      carefully, and throw away the tarragon leaves that have been steeping in
      it. Wash that jar, or take another clean one, put into it the same
      quantity of fresh tarragon leaves, and fill up with the same vinegar in
      which you have infused the first supply. Let the second leaves remain in
      the jar of vinegar. A tarragon bush is well worth planting; even in a
      small city garden.

      CURRY POWDER.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Curry powder originates in India, where it is much used as a peculiar
      flavoring for soups, stews, and hashes. With curry dishes, boiled rice is
      always served up, not only in a separate dish, but also heaped round the
      stew in a thick even border. To make curry powder, pound in a marble
      mortar three ounces of turmeric, three ounces of coriander seed, and a
      quarter of an ounce of cayenne; one ounce of mustard, one ounce of
      cardamoms, a half ounce of cummin seed, and half an ounce of mace. Let all
      these ingredients be thoroughly mixed in the mortar, and then sift it
      through a fine sieve, dry it for an hour before the fire, and put it into
      clean bottles, securing the corks well. Use from two to three
      table-spoonfuls at a time, in proportion to the size of the dish you
      intend to curry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be mixed into the gravy of any of the preceding receipts for stews.
      Two ounces of finely grated cocoa-nut is a pleasant improvement to curried
      dishes, and is universally liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curry powder you buy is frequently much adulterated with inferior
      articles. The best curry powder imported from India is of a dark green
      color, and not yellow or red. It has among its ingredients, tamarinds, <i>not</i>
      preserved, as we always get them&mdash;but raw in the shell. These
      tamarinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
      impart a pleasant acid to the mixture. For want of them use a lemon.

      an ounce of cayenne. Mix all together, put them into a glass jar or
      bottle, and seal the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      With less turmeric, you may use ginger or sassafras.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curry powder may be added to any stew of meat, poultry, or game. Boiled
      rice must always accompany a dish of curry.

    <p>
      The ingredients indispensable to all curries (and you may make a curry of
      any nice meat, or poultry, or even of oysters) is a very pungent powder,
      prepared for the purpose with turmeric. Also onions and boiled rice. In
      India there is always something acid in the mixture, as lemons, sour apple
      juice, or green tamarinds. The turmeric has a peculiar flavor of its own.

      Pick the cranberries clean, seeing that no stems, sticks, or dead leaves
      are left among them. Put them into a cullender, or sieve, and wash them
      through two waters. Cook them in a porcelain-lined, or enameled stew-pan,
      without any additional water. The water that remains about them after
      washing is quite sufficient for stewing them properly. No stewed fruit
      should be too thin or liquid. Keep a steady heat under the cranberries,
      stirring them up from the bottom frequently: and when they are soft, mash
      them with the back of the spoon. When they are quite shapeless, take them
      off the fire, and while they are very hot, stir in, gradually, an ample
      quantity of nice <i>brown</i> sugar. They require much sweetening. Season
      them with nothing else. Their natural flavor is sufficient (if well
      sweetened) and cannot be improved by spice, lemon, or any of the usual
      condiments. Always buy the largest and ripest cranberries. The best things
      are cheapest in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In stewing any sort of fruit, do not add the sugar till the fruit is done,
      and taken from the fire. If sweetened at the beginning, much of the
      strength of the sugar evaporates in cooking; besides rendering the fruit
      tough and hard, and retarding the progress of the stew.

      nutmeg; or with all these if for company. If you can get fresh lemon-peel,
      cut it into very thin slips, and put it in to stew with the apples at
      first. It is still better, and little more trouble, to grate the
      lemon-peel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fruit for pies should be stewed in the same manner as for sauce, and not
      sweetened till taken from the fire. Let the paste be baked empty in large
      deep plates, and when cool, filled to the brim with stewed fruit. A pie,
      (as we have seen them,) only half or one third full, looks very meanly&mdash;and
      tastes so.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these fruit-sauces are good receipts for stewing fruit for pies or any
      other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      We advise all families to have, among their kitchen utensils, <i>bain
      maries</i>, or double-kettles, putting the article to be stewed in the
      inner kettle, and the boiling water in the outside one. They are to be had
      of all sizes at the furnishing stores.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> They are also excellent for
      custards and boiled puddings.

      BAKED APPLE SAUCE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Core very nicely as many fine juicy apples as will fill a large
      baking-pan. All coring of apples should be done with a tin cover. This you
      can buy at a tinman's for a quarter dollar, and it is invaluable for the
      purpose. After coring the apples, pare them smooth and evenly. Put a large
      table-spoonful of cold water in the bottom of the baking-pan, and then put
      in the apples first, filling, with fine brown sugar, the hole from whence
      the core was taken out. To have them very nice, add some grated
      lemon-peel, or some rose-water. Set the pan into an oven, (not too hot,)
      close the oven, and bake till the apples are all broken and can be easily
      mashed. This way of making apple sauce, by baking in a close oven, will be
      found far superior to boiling or stewing them. They require no more water
      than is barely sufficient to give them a start at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flavoring (sugar, lemon, or rose,) may be deferred till the apples are
      baked, taken out of the oven and mashed. Then mix it in while hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boiled apple sauce is usually spoiled with too much water, rendering it
      the consistence of thin pap, weak, washy, and mean.

      The richest and best dried peaches, are those that are dried with the

      become imperceptible when the fruit is well stewed. It is a great error to
      pare peaches for drying. Apples <i>must</i> be pared, for the skin is
      tougher than that of peaches, and does not dissolve in cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prepare dried peaches for stewing, pick them over carefully, throwing
      away all the imperfect pieces. Wash them in two cold waters, and then put

    <h2>
      <a name="VEGETABLES" id="VEGETABLES"></a>VEGETABLES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All vegetables are best when fresh, as can easily be discovered by the
      difference between those newly brought from the garden, and those that
      have been kept in a provision shop till next day, (and perhaps longer,)
      imbibing the atmosphere of meat, fish, poultry, and a variety of things,
      each becoming impure from the same causes; not to mention the rats, mice,
      and insects which run over them at night. You cannot have vegetables in
      perfection without a country garden. But if obliged to depend upon the
      market or the provi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>sion
      shops, always have your vegetables washed and laid in cold water before
      cooking. Some are best when put on to boil in cold water; others require
      boiling water at the beginning, to give them what the cooks call a quick
      start. All should be thoroughly done throughout. If hard in the centre
      they are unpalatable, and very unwholesome; even worse than underdone
      meat. Use but very little salt in cooking vegetables; too much renders
      them hard, and overpowers their real taste. Also, it is easy for the
      lovers of salt to add more when at table. When vegetables are done, and
      taken out the pot, drain them well through a cullender or sieve, carefully
      pressing out all the water that is about them. There is generally, in our
      country, too much water allowed to the vegetables. Merely enough to cover
      them well, and keep them from burning, is in most cases sufficient. In
      France, so little water is used in cooking vegetables, that they are
      rather stewed than boiled, and are the better for it. A puddle of greasy
      water in the bottom of every vegetable dish is a disgusting sight; and yet
      how frequently it is seen. If of every-day occurrence, it is a certain
      indication of a bad cook, or an inefficient mistress, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost all green vegetables should be thrown into fast-boiling water, and
      cooked rapidly; first washing them carefully, and laying them for half an
      hour in a large pan of cold water. If found frozen in the winter, be sure
      to thaw them in cold water. Continue the boiling till they are<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
      thoroughly done, and with a steady heat, taking off the scum as it rises.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very usual in the spring to bring early vegetables from the south,
      for the markets of Philadelphia and New York. By the time they reach us
      they are faded, withered, tough and unwholesome. It is better to wait a
      week or two longer till the season is a little more advanced, and the
      farms and gardens of our neighborhood can supply our own markets, at a far
      less cost, and with fresher and better vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water in which vegetables have been boiled becomes very unwholesome,
      and should be thrown out immediately.
    </p>

      BOILED POTATOS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      To have boiled potatos in perfection they should all be of a good sort and
      as nearly as possible of the same size. Till it is time to cook them, let
      the slight mould or earth that has adhered to the potatos in digging, be
      carefully washed off, even scrubbing them with a hard brush. This can be
      done very conveniently, by laying them under the hydrant or pump, washing
      them there with a broom, and letting the water run on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      An iron pot is the best of all things for boiling potatos, as it retains
      the heat longer than any other utensil. Lay them in it, closely and
      compactly, and pour in barely sufficient cold water to cover them well,
      adding a tea-spoonful of salt. Simmer them till nearly done, which you may<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
      ascertain by probing all through with a fork. You may quicken the fire for
      the last five minutes. Pour off all the water from them as soon as they
      are tender all through. Lift the lid of the pot at one side to allow the
      steam to pass off, and set them beside the fire, or on a trevet far above
      it, till the moisture has escaped; the potatos will then be dry and mealy.
      Then peel them; or if preferred, send them to table with the skin on,
      which will keep them hot longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the potatos are old, cut a piece of skin (about the size of a sixpence)
      from the top and bottom before boiling; or, take off a long slip from each
      side. In the spring, when quite old, cut out all the blemishes, pare the
      potatos, and always boil them for mashing.

      ROAST POTATOS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Potatos for roasting should always be large and fine. If small, "they go
      all to skin." Select those that are nearest of a size, and wash them very
      clean, and wipe every one with a cloth. Put them into an oven, and let
      them roast or bake for more than two hours, turning them with a fork. Dish
      them in the skins, and send only cold butter to table with them. Bake
      sweet potatos in the same manner, but much longer. Small sweet potatos
      should be boiled; as, when small, they are not worth cooking in any other
      way; and when roasted there is scarcely any thing of them, but tough
      shriveled skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>.

      Pare some fine potatos all about the same size, and cover with them the
      whole bottom of a large deep earthen dish; lay them close together so that
      they all touch. Bake them under a nice piece of beef, veal, or pork,
      raised above them on a trivet. The gravy from the meat will drip upon them
      as soon as it begins to bake. They must bake till they are nicely browned,
      and till a fork will easily go through them. Have a smaller dish of
      potatos baked without meat, in a dish by themselves, as potatos pared
      before baking are much liked. Lay some bits of fresh butter among those
      that are cooked without any meat.

      FRIED POTATOS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The potatos must be raw, large, unblemished, and of a good round shape.
      First take off a thin paring of the skin. Then, pare the whole potato
      round and round, (not too thin,) till you have gone through it all, and
      nothing is left unpared but a little lump in the centre. Then put these
      continuous rings of potato into a frying-pan, in which is boiling plenty
      of fresh butter, or butter and lard mixed. Fry them<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> brown and tender, and
      arrange them handsomely in a dish for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Another Way.</i>&mdash;Slice thin a sufficiency of fine raw potatos,
      and lay them in a pan of cold water to soak for an hour or more. Then pour
      off that water entirely, and replace it with fresh. Let them remain in
      this for another hour, or till it is time to cook them. Put them into a
      frying-pan that has in it plenty of fresh butter or lard, enough, while
      frying, to keep the potatos near the surface. Fry them till perfectly well
      done and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempting to re-cook cold potatos renders them more hard and tough.

      stripped from the stalks, and scattered among the potatos. Put them into a
      stew-pan with milk enough to prevent their burning, and some fresh butter&mdash;no
      water. If you can get cream conveniently, add some to the milk. Cover the
      pan, and let the potatos stew, till, on trying them with a fork, you find
      them thoroughly cooked, and soft and tender all through. If not
      sufficiently done, they are hard, tough, leathery, and unfit to eat.

    <p>
      They are very good stewed entirely in the dripping of cold gravy of roast
      beef, veal, or pork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>&mdash;but
      not mutton, as that will give them the taste of tallow. This is a nice

      potatos once become cold, no cooking can restore them.

      BOILED CABBAGE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      All cabbage should be well washed, and boiled in a large quantity of water
      with a little salt; the loose or faded leaves being stripped from the
      outside. They should always be cut or split in two, or in four pieces if
      very large. Cut the stalk short, and split it up to where the leaves
      begin. Put it on in boiling water, and keep it boiling steadily till quite
      done, which will not be till the stalk is tender throughout. If a young
      summer cabbage, split it in half, and when well boiled, and drained and
      pressed in a cullender, serve it up with a few bits of cold fresh butter,
      laid inside among the leaves. Season it with pepper. This is a much nicer
      and easier way, than to make drawn butter, and pour over the outside of
      the cabbage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sprouts and very young greens, require nothing more than to be well
      washed, boiled and drained. In the country, cabbage sprouts are commonly
      boiled with bacon.

    <p>
      Savoy cabbage is considered the finest sort. It<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span> is a late autumn and winter
      cabbage. If very large, split it in four. Do not boil it with meat. The
      fat will render it strong and unwholesome. Still worse, when melted butter
      is added to a cabbage already saturated with the fat of corned beef.

      AN EXCELLENT WAY OF BOILING CABBAGE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Having trimmed the cabbage, and washed it well in cold water, (examining
      the leaves to see that no insects are lurking among them,) cut it almost
      into quarters, but do not divide it entirely down at the stem, which
      should be cut off just below the termination of the leaves. Let it lie an
      hour in a pan of cold water. Have ready a pot <i>full</i> of boiling
      water, seasoned with a small tea-spoonful of salt. Put the cabbage into
      it, and let it boil for an hour and a half, skimming it occasionally. Then
      take it out; put it into a cullender to drain, and when all the hot water
      has drained off; set it under the hydrant. Let the hydrant run on it, till
      the cabbage has become perfectly cold all through. If you have no hydrant,
      set it under a pump, or keep pouring cold water on it from a pitcher.
      Then, having thrown out all the first water, and washed the pot, fill it
      again, and let the second water boil. During this time the cabbage under
      the hydrant will be growing cold. Then put it on again in the second
      water, and boil it two hours, or two and a half. Even the thickest part of
      the stalk must be perfectly tender all through. When thoroughly done, take
      up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
      cabbage, drain it well through the cullender, pressing it down with a
      broad ladle to squeeze out all the moisture; lay it in a deep dish, and
      cut it <i>entirely</i> apart, dividing it into quarters. Lay some bits of
      fresh butter among the leaves, add a little pepper, cover the dish, and
      send it to table hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cooked in this manner it will be made perfectly wholesome, and the usually

      tongue minced also, grated bread-crumbs, fresh butter, powdered mace,
      sweet marjoram and sweet basil, grated lemon-peel, and two hard-boiled

      into a stew-pan a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, nearly half of the
      grated cheese, two large table-spoonfuls of cream or rich milk, and a very
      little salt and cayenne. Toss or shake it over the fire till it is well
      mixed and has come to a boil. Then add the tufts of cauliflower, and let
      the whole stew together about five minutes. When done put it into a deep
      dish, strew over the top the remaining half of the grated cheese, and
      brown it with a salamander or a red-hot shovel held above the surface.

      BROCCOLI AND EGGS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take several heads of broccoli and cut the stalks short, paring off from
      the stalks the tough outside skin. Trim off the small outside shoots or
      blossoms, and tie them together in bunches. After all the broccoli has
      been washed, and lain half an hour or more in a pan of fresh cold water,
      put the large heads, with a salt-spoonful of salt, into a pot of boiling
      water, and let them boil till thoroughly done, and the stalk perfectly
      tender. When the large heads have boiled about a quarter of an hour, put
      in the small tufts, which of course require less time to cook. In the
      meanwhile have ready six beaten eggs. Put a quarter of a pound of butter
      into a sauce-pan, and stir it over the fire till it is all melted; then
      add gradually the beaten eggs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362"

      crust. Dip the toast for a minute in hot water. Pour the egg and butter
      over the hot toast. Then place upon it the broccoli; the largest and
      finest head in the middle, the lesser ones round it, and having untied the
      small sprigs, lay them in a circle close to the edge.

      FRIED CELERY.&mdash;

      Take fine large celery, cut it into pieces three or four inches in length,
      and boil it tender, having seasoned the water with a very little salt.
      Then drain the pieces well, and lay them, separately, to cool on a large
      dish. Make a batter in the proportion of three well-beaten eggs stirred
      into a pint of rich milk, alternately with half a pint of grated
      bread-crumbs, or of sifted flour. Beat the batter very hard after it is
      all mixed. Put into a hot frying-pan a sufficiency of fresh lard; melt it
      over the fire, and when it comes to a boil, dip each piece of celery <i>twice</i>
      into the batter, put them into the pan, and fry them a light brown. When
      done, lay them to drain on an inverted sieve with a broad pan placed
      beneath it. Then dish the fried celery, and send it to table hot.

    <p>
      Parsnips, and salsify, (or oyster plant) may be fried in butter according

      FRIED ARTICHOKES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The artichokes must be young and tender. Cut them into quarters, remove
      the choke part, and strip off the leaves. Having washed the artichokes
      well and laid them an hour in cold water, put them into a pot of boiling
      water, and keep them boiling steadily for a long time, till you find by
      trying them with a a fork that they are tender all through. Then take them
      out immediately, and drain them. Have ready a sufficiency of batter, made
      in the proportion of the yolk of one egg to a large table-spoonful of
      milk, and a tea-spoonful of flour. The eggs must be well beaten before
      they are mixed with the milk; then beat in the flour a spoonful at a time.
      Have ready over the fire some fresh butter, or lard, in a frying-pan. When
      it has boiled hard, dip the artichokes into the butter, (each piece should
      be twice dipped,) and fry them brown. Then drain them well, and send them
      to table hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parsnips may be fried as above. Salsify also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way of frying artichokes, parsnips, and salsify, is, after they
      have been boiled tender, to dip each piece first in beaten yolk of egg,
      (without milk or flour,) and then roll it in finely grated bread-crumbs.
      Then put them into the pan and fry them in butter or lard, or a mixture of
      both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In boiling artichokes, observe to take them out as soon as they are
      tender. If they remain in the water after they are done, they turn
      blackish and lose their flavor.

      MUSHROOM OMELET.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take some fresh-gathered mushrooms; remove the stalks, and rub the flaps
      or heads very slightly with a little salt, mixed with cayenne. Then stew
      the mushrooms in a small sauce-pan, with barely sufficient cream or rich
      milk to cover them. Put in with them a small onion; and if the onion is
      found to turn blackish, throw away the whole; it being proof that there is
      among them a false or poisonous mushroom. Stir them with a silver spoon,
      and keep on the lid of the pan closely, unless when you are stirring. If
      the spoon turns black, the mushrooms should not be eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they have come to a boil, take them off the fire; drain them, and
      when cool, chop them small. To a pint or more of the minced mushrooms,
      allow six or seven eggs. Beat the eggs till very light and thick,
      (omitting the whites of two,) and then mix in, gradually, the mushrooms,
      stirring the whole very hard. Put three ounces of fresh butter into a hot
      omelet pan, or a <i>small</i> frying-pan; place it over the fire and stir
      the butter as it melts. When it has boiled hard, put in the omelet
      mixture, and as it fries, stir it till it begins to set. Do not turn the
      omelet; but brown the top by holding close above it a red-hot<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span> shovel.
      When done, drain off the butter, fold over or double the omelet, and serve
      it up immediately on a hot dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In gathering mushrooms, those that are fit to eat may be known by their
      being of a pale pearl color, or of a grayish white, instead of what is
      called a dead white; and the underside of the flap or head (if good) is of
      a light pink, or a pinkish salmon color. The best mushrooms grow on
      uplands, or in high open fields where the air is pure and good, and they
      should be gathered early in the morning before the dew is off. All that
      are found in low swampy ground, or in the woods, or under large trees, are
      poisonous.

      minutes, or till perfectly tender. Then drain it, and chop small all the
      green part. Beat four eggs very light, and add to them a wine-glass of
      cream. Mix the chopped asparagus thoroughly with the egg and cream, adding
      a salt-spoon of salt, and a very little cayenne. Melt a large slice of
      fresh butter in a frying-pan over the fire; and when it has boiled, and
      the bubbling has ceased, put in the mixture, and fry it till light and
      firm. Then slip it from the frying-pan to a hot dish, and fold it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a soft omelet, put the mixture into a skillet with a piece of fresh
      butter. Let it stew slowly for ten minutes. Lay a thin slice of buttered

      throwing a handful of salt in the outside tin, taking care that none of
      the salt gets into the inside. When the spinach is well stewed, take it up
      and drain it without squeezing or pressing, as that will make it tough and
      dry. Then chop it small, and add some hard-boiled eggs, also chopped.
      Season it with pepper and fresh butter, stir it well together, return it
      to the kettle, and let it stew a quarter of an hour or more. Serve it up
      with buttered toast and poached eggs laid upon it.

      Spinach being very watery, should always be <i>stewed</i> rather than

      water, (very cold) and having pared the cucumbers, slice them into it.
      Transfer them to a deep china or white-ware dish. Season them with
      vinegar, pepper, salt, and a little salad oil, taking care not to use too
      much salt. When there is no dislike to onions, peel and slice a few that
      are mild, and mix them with the cucumbers. It is usual now, at the best
      tables, to have the onions in a small separate dish, (sliced with vinegar

      A NICE WAY OF COOKING ASPARAGUS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Where asparagus is plenty, there is no better way of cooking it than the
      following. Take it as nearly of a size as possible, wash it, and cut off
      the stalks very short, leaving them not more than half an inch in length.
      Two quarts of water will be sufficient to boil one quart of asparagus
      tops; allow a tea-spoonful of salt to this quantity of water, and set it
      over the fire to boil. When the water is boiling hard, put in the
      asparagus, and boil it fast for at least half an hour. To see if it is
      done, take up two or three of the largest pieces and taste them. While it
      is boiling, prepare two slices of bread cut half an inch thick, and
      (having removed the crust) toast the bread brown on both sides. Have ready
      a large jill of melted (or drawn) fresh butter. When the asparagus is
      done, take it up with a perforated skimmer, and lay it on a sieve to
      drain. Dip the slices of toast (one at a time) first in the hot asparagus
      liquor, and then in the melted butter. Lay the slices, side by side, in a
      deep dish, and cover it with the asparagus, laid evenly over and round the
      toast. Then add the remainder of the drawn butter, and send the asparagus
      to table hot, in a covered dish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372"
      id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a much nicer way than that of boiling and serving it up with the
      long stalks left on. And where you have asparagus in abundance, (for
      instance in a country garden,) it may always be cooked in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is from the receipt of Mr. N. Darling, of New Haven.

      into a stew-pan, with enough of oyster liquor (previously strained) to

      some more of their liquor, seasoned with pepper, mace, and nutmeg, adding
      a large piece of fresh butter, divided into four, and each part rolled in
      flour. Do not let the oysters stew more than five minutes, or they will
      become tough and shriveled. When they are merely plumped, take them out
      and cut them up small, omitting the gristle or hard part. Set the mixture
      over the fire for about five minutes, stirring all the time. Have ready
      some slices of nice toast, with all the crust pared off; the slices dipped
      for a minute in hot water. Butter the toast, and cover with it the bottom

      ONION EGGS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Boil a dozen eggs quite hard. Slice and fry in fresh butter five or six
      onions. Slice (whites and yolks together) ten of the eggs, reserving two
      for the seasoning. Drain the sliced onions, and lay them on a dish with
      the sliced eggs placed upon them. Cover the dish, and keep it hot. Take
      the two remaining eggs, grate the yolks, and mix them with cream and
      grated nutmeg, and a very little cayenne. Put this mixture into a very
      small sauce-pan, give it one boil up, pour it over the eggs and onions,
      and send it to table hot. For those who have no objection to onions this
      is a nice side dish.

      Afterwards add salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and powdered nutmeg, to your

      Stew the whole slowly in a porcelain kettle for three hours, (stirring it
      frequently from the bottom,) till it becomes a smooth, thick paste. Then
      put it into small jars or glasses, and cover it closely, pasting paper
      over each. It is an excellent sauce, at the season when fresh tomatos are
      not to be had, and is very good to thicken soup.

      ONIONS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The best onions for cooking are the white or silver-skinned. The
      red-skinned are generally strong and coarse. Shalots are very small and
      delicate. Some sorts of large onions are milder and nicer than those of
      middle size, and some that are very small have a powerful taste and smell.
      The outer skin of most onions should be peeled entirely, and the ends cut
      off. All onions are the better for boiling, before they are cooked for any
      other purpose. Put them into a stew-pan with cold water, and when they
      have come to a boil pour off that water, and replace it with fresh cold
      also. Boil them slowly till quite tender all through, which will not be in
      less than half an hour; more, if they are large. When done, drain them
      well, dish them, and pour over them some nice melted butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Stew Onions.</i>&mdash;Peel, slice them, and stew them in milk,
      enriched with butter rolled in flour, and seasoned with a little cayenne
      and a few blades of mace.

    <p>
      <i>To Roast Onions.</i>&mdash;Select fine large onions; do not peel them,
      but place them in a bake-pan, and set them in an oven. Bake them slowly
      till tender all through. When done, peel off the outer skin,<span

      them hot to table, to eat with pepper and cold butter.

      They are very good when covered up and roasted under hot ashes, taking

      TO BOIL GREEN PEAS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      When the peas are shelled, wash them in a pan of cold water. Put on the
      peas in cold water, (a little salted) and let them boil very fast. If nice
      peas, they will generally be done in a quarter of an hour after beginning
      to boil. When simmering, add to them a lump or a spoonful of loaf-sugar,
      and a sprig of fresh green mint, (half a dozen leaves) having first
      ascertained if mint is not disliked by any person who is to eat of the
      peas. To some the taste and odor of mint is very agreeable, to others very
      disgusting, as is the case with onions, and many other things that are
      liked by the majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the peas are all soft or tender, take out the mint, drain the peas
      through a cullender till not a drop of water is left among them; transfer
      them to a deep dish, mix into them some of the best fresh butter, and

      GREEN PEAS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The largest and finest peas are what the English call marrowfat. The sugar
      pea is next. All green peas for boiling should be young and tender, but
      not so young as to be tasteless or insipid. As a general rule, nearly
      every article of food is best when it has just attained its full growth
      and ripeness; after that period the older it is the worse. Peas, so old as
      to be hard and yellow, are unfit to eat. In some ultra economical houses,
      good peas are things unknown. They are not bought in spring or early
      summer while young and fresh, but are never thought cheap enough till they
      become hard and yellow. Afterwards, when they reach the cheap state, a
      quantity are bought low, and put into jars not to be touched till next
      spring, when they are boiled, (with great difficulty, for they never
      become soft,) and <i>attempted</i> to be passed off "as this year's fresh
      peas"&mdash;and by the time the family have gotten through with <i>them</i>,
      "this year's young peas" have become old. Do not believe (for it is
      untrue,) that any eatable can be kept in <i>all</i> its genuine freshness
      and original flavor, by merely secluding them<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span> entirely from air. They
      will not spoil or decompose if skillfully managed; but they <i>have not
      exactly</i> their natural taste and consistence. It is better for those
      who <i>never make pickles or preserves</i>, to wait for fresh vegetables
      or fruit, till they are actually in market&mdash;or, if put up in jars, to
      add something more than parboiling and seclusion from the air. Vinegar,
      salt, sugar, spice and alcohol, will be found the grand and universal
      articles for securing the goodness of nearly all eatables. Without some of
      these along with them, things that have not spoiled while secluded from
      air, will surely spoil almost as soon as the jars are opened, and the
      external air admitted to them.

      GREEN OR STRING BEANS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take young and tender beans, the seeds just forming in the pods. Take off
      the string with a knife, leaving no bits of string adhering to the beans,
      either at top or bottom. Do not split them. Cut each bean into three
      pieces, <i>not more</i>, and as you cut them throw them into a pan of cold
      water, kept beside you for the purpose. The old-fashioned way is now
      obsolete of cutting them into dice or diamonds, or of splitting them. The
      more they are cut up (beside the trouble and time wasted,) the more the
      water gets through them when cooking; the more tasteless they become, and
      the more difficult they are to drain. We have never met with beans that,
      when cut small, had not a puddle of greasy water in the bottom of the
      dish, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
      sometimes the water was all through the dish, and the beans floating in
      it. Shame on such bean-cooking! When the beans are all ready for the pot,
      throw them into boiling water very slightly salted, and they will
      generally be done in half an hour after they have come to a boil. Transfer
      them to a sieve; and press, and drain them well, till no water is left
      about them. Then put them into a deep dish, mix them with fresh butter,
      and dredge them with black pepper.

      SWEET POTATOS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Choose the sweet potatos large, and nearly of the same size, then you can
      either boil or roast them. When small they should always be boiled; as,
      when baked or roasted, the skin becomes so thick and hard, that it takes
      up nearly the whole potato. Wash them very clean, and cut off a bit from
      each end. Put them into a large pot of boiling water without<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> salt,
      and boil them steadily for at least an hour. Probe them with a
      narrow-bladed sharp knife, and if it does not easily penetrate all through
      the largest potato, (in at one side and out at the other) continue the
      boiling till all are soft throughout. Then take them up, peel them, and
      keep them warm till sent to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Bake Sweet Potatos</i> they should all be large. Wash them, dry
      them, and cut off the ends. Then bake them in an oven, lying side by side,
      not piling one on another. Or else (which is better) roast them in hot
      ashes. They will not be done in less than an hour and a half, perhaps
      longer. Then wipe them clean, and serve them up in the skins. Eat them
      from the skins, with cold butter and a tea-spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Stew Sweet Potatos.</i>&mdash;Wash and wipe them. Then scrape off
      the skins with a sharp knife. Split them, and cut them into long pieces.
      Stew them with fresh pork, veal, or beef; first putting at the bottom a
      very little butter or water to start them, and then the gravy of the meat
      will suffice for cooking them&mdash;skimming it well. Water to stew should
      be hot.

    <p>
      <i>Mashed Sweet Potatos</i> are very nice. When well boiled, mash them
      smoothly with a potato beetle. Mix them with fresh butter, and then stir
      them well, or beat them with a large wooden spoon to render them light.
      Afterwards, you may make them into round thick cakes, and touch the
      surface of every one with pepper&mdash;red or black. This is a breakfast

      BOILED TURNIPS.&mdash;

      Have all your turnips nearly of the same size. Pare them; and if large cut
      them in half. Put them into boiling water, very slightly salted, and keep
      them closely covered. Twenty minutes will boil them if very small and
      young; their flavor is then very fine. Afterwards, according to their
      size, they will require of gentle boiling, from three-quarters to a full
      hour. Keep them boiling till, on trying them with a fork, you find them
      perfectly tender all through. Then take them up, drain them well, and pour
      melted butter over them; touch the top of each with a spot of black
      pepper. If very old and spongy, they are only fit for the pig barrel. It
      is said that if boiled in their skins, (though requiring a much longer
      time to cook well) they have a fine flavor, and are less watery. You can
      try it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the turnips are to be mashed, cut them into small pieces, boil them
      very soft, and drain and squeeze them till all the water is pressed out.
      Then mash them very smooth. Transfer them to a deep dish, and mix them
      with a <i>moderate portion</i> of fresh butter. Turnips are generally
      served with too much butter. Season them with pepper. When sent to table
      take care not to set them in a sunny place, as it will give them a bad

      SYDNEY SMITH'S SALAD-DRESSING.&mdash;

      Have ready two well-boiled potatos, peeled and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> rubbed through a sieve;
      they will give peculiar smoothness to the mixture. Also, a very small
      portion of raw onion, not more than a <i>quarter</i> of a tea-spoonful,
      (as the presence of the onion is to be scarcely hinted,) and the pounded
      yolks of two hard-boiled eggs. Mix these ingredients on a deep plate with
      one tea-spoonful of salt, one of made mustard, three table-spoonfuls of
      olive oil, and one table-spoonful of vinegar. Add, lastly, a tea-spoonful
      of essence of anchovy; mash, and mix the whole together, (using a boxwood
      spoon) and see that all the articles are thoroughly amalgamated. Having
      cut up a sufficiency of lettuce, that has been well washed in cold water,
      and drained, add to it the dressing immediately before dinner, mixing the
      lettuce through it with a boxwood fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      This salad dressing was invented by the Rev. Sydney Smith, whose genius as
      a writer and a wit is well known on both sides the Atlantic. If <i>exactly</i>
      followed, it will be found very fine on trial; no peculiar flavor
      predominating, but excellent as a whole. The above directions are taken
      from a manuscript receipt given by Mr. Smith to an American gentleman then
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      In preparing this, or any other salad-dressing, take care not to use that
      excessively pungent and deleterious combination of drugs which is now so
      frequently imposed upon the public, as <i>the best white wine vinegar</i>.
      In reality, it has no vinous material about it; and it may be known by its
      violent and disagreeable sharpness, which overpowers<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> and destroys the taste (and
      also the substance) of whatever it is mixed with. It is also very
      unwholesome. Its color is always pale, and it is nearly as clear as water.
      No one should buy or use it. The first quality of <i>real</i> cider
      vinegar is good for all purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above receipt may be tried for lobster dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Spanish proverb says, that for compounding a <i>good</i> salad, four
      persons are required&mdash;a spend-thrift for oil; a miser for vinegar; a
      man of judgment for salt; and a madman for stirring the dressing.

      Having skinned a pair of cold fowls, remove the fat, and carve them as if
      for eating; cut all the flesh entirely from the bones, and either mince it

      minced chicken in a close heap in the centre. For the dressing, mix
      together the following ingredients, in the proportion of the yolks of four
      eggs well beaten, a tea-spoonful of powdered white sugar, a salt-spoon of
      cayenne; (no salt if you have ham or tongue with the chicken,) two
      tea-spoonfuls of made mustard, six table-spoonfuls of salad oil, and five
      of celery vinegar. Stir this mixture well: put it into a small<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
      sauce-pan, set it over the fire, and let it boil three minutes,(not more,)
      stirring it all the time. Then set it to cool. When quite cold, cover with
      it thickly, the heap of chicken in the centre of the salad. To ornament
      it, have ready half a dozen or more, hard-boiled eggs, which, after the
      shell is peeled off, must be thrown directly into a pan of cold water to
      prevent them from turning blue. Cut each egg (white and yolk together)
      lengthways into four long pieces of equal size and shape; lay the pieces
      upon the salad all round the heap of chicken, and close to it; placing
      them so as to follow each other round in a slanting direction, something
      in the form of a circular wreath of leaves. Have ready, also, some very
      red cold beet, cut into small cones or points all of equal size; arrange
      them in a circle upon the lettuce, outside of the circle of cut egg. To be
      decorated in this manner, the salad should be placed in a dish rather than
      a bowl. In helping it, give each person a portion of every thing, and they
      will mix them together on their plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      This salad should be prepared immediately before dinner or supper; as
      standing long will injure it. The colder it is the better.

      CARROTS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Having washed the carrots, and scraped off the outer skin with a sharp
      knife, or taken off a very thin paring, split them a few inches down,
      leaving a long cleft in the upper half only, and put them on to cook in
      plenty of boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
      water, with a little salt in it. There is no table vegetable that needs
      more boiling than a carrot. Small young carrots require at least half an
      hour. If large, they must boil from one to two hours, according to their
      size. When you find them tender throughout, dish them, with melted butter
      poured round them. They are eaten plain, only with boiled beef or boiled
      mutton. They are often added to soups and stews, when they must be put in
      long before the other vegetables. For soups and stews the nicest way is to
      grate them (before boiling,) on a coarse grater. This way they improve
      both the taste and color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrots are very nice, sliced thin after boiling, put into a sauce-pan,
      with bits of butter dredged with flour, seasoned with pepper, and stewed
      soft without any water.

      Scrape the parsnips, and split them half way down. Put them into boiling
      water with a little salt. Parsnips require less boiling than carrots; and,
      according to their size, will take from half an hour to an hour. Skim the
      water while they are boiling. When quite tender take them up, drain them,
      dish them, and pour melted butter over them. They are especially eaten
      with corned pork, or salted cod; but are good with various things. They
      are excellent stewed with fresh beef, or fresh pork, for a plain dinner.

      Beets must be washed very clean, but not scraped, trimmed, or cut till
      after they are boiled. Put them on in boiling water; and, according to
      their size, boil them steadily from one hour and a half, to two hours and
      a half, but they must not be probed (to ascertain if they are tender all
      through,) but pinched with the fingers. Then peel off the skins, and trim
      them neatly. Hold the beet in a pan of cold water while you peel it. Do it
      quickly. Serve them up either split or sliced, with melted butter poured
      over them, and seasoned with pepper. Or else they<span class="pagenum"><a

      (allowing them to get cold,) and spiced vinegar poured over them. Red
      beets are usually dressed with vinegar; the white or pale ones with melted
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Baked Beets</i> have a finer flavor, and are more nutritious than when
      boiled. Wash and wipe them dry, but do not skin or cut them till after
      cooking. They must be thoroughly done before they are taken out of the
      oven, and then pared and trimmed. According to their size they will
      require from four to six hours baking. Their blood-red color makes them
      ornamental to the table; but when cooked in soups or stews they add little
      to the taste, which is overpowered by that of other ingredients.

      SQUASHES OR CYMLINGS.&mdash;

      See that the squashes are not turning old, and hardening. Wash them, and
      cut them into four pieces each; but do not split them. Put them on in
      boiling water, with a little salt. Boil them steadily till quite tender
      throughout. Then take them up, and mash or drain them through a cullender,
      pressing them with a broad short-handled wooden ladle. All the water (of
      which there will be a profusion,) must be entirely squeezed out. Serve
      them up very dry, and smoothly and evenly mashed, having first mixed with
      them a <i>very little butter</i>; and season them with very little pepper.
      Much butter gives them a disagreeable taste and consistence, and the
      butter should be fresh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389"

      turnips, pumpkins, &amp;c., without any butter, than to use that which is
      salt and bad. The flat white ones are the best summer squashes; the
      striped green are more watery; the cashaw, or yellow winter squash, is
      best of all, and grows well in the New England states, from whence, as it
      keeps well all winter, it is often brought in barrels. Every family should
      get a barrel of winter squashes from Boston. They do not thrive in the
      middle States. In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, they cannot be raised even
      from the best yankee seed, turning pumpkinish the next year, and
      afterwards becoming quite pumpkins, and very bad ones too. But when raised
      in their native soil and climate nothing of the squash kind is equal to
      them. They are very dry and sweet, and of a rich yellow color. Take them
      out of the barrel, and keep them far apart on the shelves or floor of a
      dry pantry.

      TO BOIL INDIAN CORN.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Corn for boiling should be full grown, but young and tender, and the
      grains soft and milky. If its grains are becoming hard and yellow, it is
      too old for cooking. Strip the ears of their leaves and the silk. Put them
      into a large pot of boiling water, and boil it rather fast for half an
      hour or more, in proportion to its size and age. When done, take it up,
      drain it, dish it under a cover, or napkin,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> and serve it up hot. Before
      eating it, rub each ear with salt and pepper, and then spread it with
      butter. Epicures in corn consider it sweetest when eaten off the cob. And
      so it is; but <i>before company</i> few persons like to hold an ear of
      indian corn in their hands, and bite the grains off the cob with their
      teeth. Therefore, it is more frequently cut off the cob into a dish; mixed
      with salt, pepper, and butter, and helped with a spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that young green corn will boil sufficiently in ten minutes,
      (putting it, <i>of course</i>, into a pot of boiling water.) Try it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Another way.</i>&mdash;Having pulled off the silk, boil the corn
      without removing any but the outside leaves. With the leaves or husk on,
      it will require a longer time to cook, but is sweeter and more nutritious.

      Hominy is white indian corn, shelled from the cob, divested of the outer

      white. Having washed it through two or three waters, pour boiling water on
      it; cover it, and let it soak all night, or for several hours. Then put it

      salt, and the butter. Then mix it gradually with the milk, and set it away
      to cool. Beat the eggs very light, and add them gradually to the mixture.
      The whole should make a thick batter. Then bake them on a griddle, in the
      manner of buckwheat cakes, rubbing or scraping the griddle always before

      This is made of dried shelled beans and hard corn, soaked over night in

      CAROLINA WAY OF BOILING RICE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Pick the rice carefully, and wash it through two<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span> or three cold waters till
      it is quite clean. Then (having drained off all the water through a
      cullender,) put the rice into a pot of boiling water, with a very little
      salt, allowing as much as a quart of water to half a pint of rice. Boil it
      twenty minutes or more. Then pour off the water, draining the rice as dry
      as possible. Lastly, set it on hot coals with the lid off, that the steam
      may not condense upon it and render the rice watery. Keep it drying thus
      for a quarter of an hour. Put it into a deep dish, and loosen and toss it
      up from the bottom with two forks, one in each hand, so that the grains
      may appear to stand alone.

      TOMATOS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Tomatos require long cooking; otherwise they will have a raw taste, and be
      quite too acid. Take fine tomatos that are quite ripe, put them into a
      pan, and scald them in very hot water. Let them remain for ten minutes, or
      till you can peel them without scalding your hands. Drain them through a
      sieve. You may either press out all the seeds, (retaining only the pulp or
      liquid,) or leave the seeds in, squeezing the tomatos slightly. Put them
      into a stew-pan, which must on no account be of copper, as the acid of the
      tomatos will render it poisonous. We knew a lady who died in agonies from
      eating tomatos cooked in a copper vessel that had the tinning partly worn
      off. If the tin inside is indispensable, (which it is) why have any copper
      about it? A vessel of <i>double</i> block tin only, will last as long,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> and
      stand the fire as well as if there was copper inside. For all stews, an
      iron pan, lined with delft (or what is called porcelain or enamel) is
      excellent. Best of all for stewing tomatos, and many other things, is a <i>bain
      marie</i>, or double kettle, with the water outside, in the outer kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having nearly filled the stew-pan with the tomatos, (cut up, if they are
      large) add a little salt and pepper, a piece of fresh butter dredged with
      flour, and (if approved) a very little chopped onion. If you have
      ready-boiled onions at hand, take one or two of them and mince it fine.
      Add to the tomatos some powdered white sugar to lessen the excessive acid.
      Put but very few bread-crumbs&mdash;if too many, they will weaken the
      taste. Tomatos are an improvement to every kind of plain soups, and may be
      added, with advantage, after the soup is in the tureen. The cooking of
      tomatos should be commenced at least three hours before dinner. Put no
      water with them&mdash;their own juice is sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons like tomatos raw, sliced like cucumbers, and seasoned with
      vinegar and pepper.

      TO KEEP TOMATO PULP.&mdash;

      Having boiled them till entirely dissolved, (adding a little salt and
      pepper) press and strain them through a sieve, pour the liquor into pint
      or half-pint bottles, (which must be perfectly clean) and stand the
      bottles up in a large iron pot or oven, with a layer of straw in the
      bottom. Fill up the pot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399"
      id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> with cold water, cork them tightly, and let
      the water boil round the bottles for five hours. As it boils away, fill up
      with more hot water. When you take them out, put a spoonful of salad oil
      at the top of each bottle; seal the bottles with rosin cement. This pulp
      will be good for tomato purposes till next summer, if kept in a cool dry
      place. When you open a bottle use it fast, or cork it again immediately.

      bread-crumbs, butter, minced veal or pork, mace, nutmeg, and sweet
      marjoram. Having stewed this stuffing in a sauce-pan, (moistening it with
      tomato juice, or gravy) fill all the tomatos with it, opening them out a
      little like the leaves of a tulip. Butter slightly a heated gridiron, and
      broil them on it. Or, they may be baked in an oven.

      BUTTON TOMATOS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      These are the very smallest tomatos, and are excellent for pickling and
      preserving. If quite ripe, and free from blemishes, they will keep very
      well in cold vinegar, and are the easiest done of all pickles. There are
      two sorts of button tomatos, the red and the yel<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>low, both equally good. Wipe
      every tomato clean and dry, and put them into small glass jars that have a
      cover. Fill the jars two-thirds with the tomatos, and then fill up to the
      top with the best cider vinegar. On the top put a table-spoonful of salad
      oil, and cover them closely. They require nothing to secure their keeping
      well. But the taste will be improved, by putting in with them, three very
      small thin muslin bags, each containing mace, nutmeg, and ginger, broken
      small, but not powdered. Lay one bag of spice at the bottom of the jar;
      one about the middle, and one near the top. If done without spice, they
      are the cheapest of all pickles. Do not put them into soups or stews; but
      eat them cold with meat, like other pickles.
    </p>
    <p>
      If kegs of these tomatos were carried to sea, and liberally served out to
      the crew, the scurvy would be less frequent, even on long voyages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large whole tomatos would do for this purpose. We wish it were the
      universal custom in ships to take out with them plenty of tomatos kept in

      HINTS ON HEATING OVENS AND BAKING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Brick ovens are generally heated with dry fagots or small branches, or
      with light split wood. For baking bread, the oven-wood must be heavier
      than for pies. A heap of wood should be placed in the centre of the oven
      on the brick floor, and then set on fire. While the wood is burning, the
      door of the oven must be left open. When the wood is all burnt down, and
      reduced to a mass of small red coals, the oven will be very hot. Then
      shovel out all the coals and sweep the oven floor with a broom, till it is
      perfectly clean, and entirely free from ashes. Try the heat within. For
      baking bread, the floor of the oven should look red, and a little flour
      thrown in should burn brown immediately. If you can hold your hand within
      the mouth of the oven as long as you can distinctly count twenty, the heat
      is about right. Pies, puddings, &amp;c., require less heat. When a brick
      oven is used, a peel, or large broad-bladed long-handled wooden shovel is
      necessary for putting in the bread, pies, &amp;c., placing them on the
      broad or shovel-end of the peel, and slipping them off on the oven floor.
      Then close up the door of the oven, and leave the things to bake. When
      done, slip the peel beneath them, and hand them out on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bake in an Iron Dutch oven, (a large deep, cast-iron pan, with a
      handle, a close-fitting lid, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402"
      id="Page_402">[402]</a></span> standing on three or four feet,) you must
      first stand the lid upright before a clear fire to heat the inside; and it
      will be best if the oven itself is also stood up before the fire for the
      same purpose. This should be done while the article to be baked is
      preparing, that it may be put in as soon as it is ready. The oven may be
      suspended to the crane, and hung over the fire, or it may be set on a bed
      of hot wood coals in the corner of the hearth. As soon as the loaf or pie
      is in, put on the lid of the oven, and cover it all over with hot coals,
      replenishing it with more live coals as the baking proceeds. If you find
      it too hot on the top, deaden it with ashes. If the oven stands on the
      hearth, keep up the heat at the bottom, by additional live coals placed
      beneath it. Whether the oven is hung over the fire, or stood on the
      hearth, there must always be hot coals all over the lid, the hottest near
      the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bake on a griddle, you may either hang it over the fire, or set it over
      hot coals on the hearth. Most griddles have feet. The fire must be quite
      clear and bright, and free from smoke, or the cakes will be blackened, and
      have a disagreeable taste. The griddle must be perfectly clean; and while
      you are baking, it will require frequent scraping, with a broad knife. If
      it is well scraped after every cake is taken off, it will not want
      greasing, as there will be no stickiness. Otherwise, some butter tied up
      in a clean rag and laid on a saucer, must be kept at hand all the time, to
      rub over the griddle between the baking of each<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span> cake; for butter, lard, or
      nice beef or veal dripping may be substituted, but it will not be so fine.
      Never grease with mutton fat, as it will communicate the taste of tallow.
      A bit of the fat of <i>fresh</i> pork may do, (stuck on a fork,) but salt
      pork will give the outside of the cakes a disagreeable saltness, and
      therefore should not be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      A griddle may be placed in the oven of a hot stove. Some close stoves have
      a hole in the top with a flat lid or cover, which lid can be used as a
      griddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tin-reflecting ovens (with shelves for the pies and cakes) that are
      used for baking in the summer, and that, having a furnace beneath, and a
      chimney-pipe, can be set out of doors, so that the kitchen may not be kept
      hot, are very good for things that will bake soon, and that do not require
      what is called a strong, solid heat. But they are not effective unless the
      inside is kept <i>very bright</i>; otherwise it will not reflect the heat.
      The tin ovens should (as well as tin roasters) be cleaned thoroughly and
      scoured bright with sand every time they are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The art of baking with anthracite, (or any other mineral coal,) can only
      be acquired by practice. The above hints on baking, refer exclusively to
      wood fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a charcoal furnace is used for baking, stewing, or any sort of
      cooking, it should either be set out in the open air, or the door of the
      kitchen must be kept open all the time. The<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span> vapor of charcoal in a
      close room is so deleterious as to cause death.

      DRIED CORN MEAL YEAST CAKES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Half a pound of fresh hops, four quarts of water, a pint of wheat or rye
      flour, half a pint of strong fresh yeast from the brewer or baker, three
      pints or more of indian meal. Boil half a pound of fresh hops in four
      quarts of water, till the liquid is reduced to two quarts. Strain it into
      a pan, and mix in sufficient wheat flour to make a thin batter, adding
      half a pint of the best yeast you can procure. Leave it to ferment; and
      when the fermentation is over, stir in sufficient indian meal to make a
      moderately stiff dough. Cover it, and set in a warm place to rise. When it
      has become very light, roll it out into a square sheet an inch thick, and
      cut it into flat cakes, about four inches square. Spread them out
      separately, on a large dish, and let them dry slowly in a cool place where
      there is no sun. While drying, turn them five or six times a day. When
      they are quite dry and hard, put them, separately, into brown paper bags,
      and keep them in a box closely covered, and in a place not the least damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you want them to use for yeast, dissolve in a little warm water one
      or more of the cakes, in proportion to the quantity of bread you intend
      making. When it is quite dissolved, stir it hard, thicken it with a little
      wheat flour, cover it, and place it near the fire to rise, before you use
      it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>.
      Then mix it with the flour, according to the usual manner of making bread.
      One yeast cake is enough for two quarts of meal or flour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This way of preserving yeast is very convenient for keeping through the
      summer, or for conveying to a distance.

      EXCELLENT HOME-MADE YEAST.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Yeast should always be kept in a glass bottle or a stone jug, and never in
      earthen or metal. Before you make fresh yeast, empty entirely the vessel
      that has contained the last; and if of stone, scald it twice with boiling
      water, in which it will be well to mix a little clear lye. Then rince it
      with cold water, till perfectly clean. If you have not used lye in
      scalding it, dissolve some potash or pearlash in the rinsing water, to
      remove any acidity that may linger about the vessel, and may therefore
      spoil the new yeast. If you keep your yeast in glass bottles, the water
      must be warm, but not hot; as scalding water may crack them: also, melt
      some potash or pearlash in this water. The vessel for keeping it being
      purified, proceed to make your yeast. Have ready, in a kettle over the
      fire, two quarts of boiling water; put into it a very large handful of
      hops, (as fine and fresh as possible,) and let the water boil again with
      the hops in it for twenty minutes more. Sift into a pan three pints of
      wheat flour. Strain the liquor from the hops into a large bowl, and pour
      half of it hot over the flour. Stir it well, and press out all the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span> lumps
      till it is quite smooth. Let the other half of the liquid stand till it is
      cool, and then pour it gradually to the rest; mixing it well, by stirring
      as you proceed. Then take half a pint of good strong yeast&mdash;brewer's
      or baker's yeast, if you can get it fresh; if not, you must use some that
      has been left from your last making, provided it is not the least sour;
      stir this yeast into the mixture of hop water and flour, put it
      immediately into your jug or bottles, and cork it loosely till the
      fermentation is over, (which should be in an hour,) and it will then be
      fit for use. Afterwards cork it tightly. It will keep better if you put a
      raisin or two into the bottom of each bottle, before you pour in the fresh
      yeast. Into a stone jug put half a dozen raisins.
    </p>
    <p>
      All yeast is better and more powerful for being fresh. It is better to
      make it frequently, (the trouble being little,) than to risk its becoming
      sour by endeavoring to keep it too long. When sour it becomes weak and
      watery, and tastes and smells disagreeably, and will never make light
      bread; besides, being very unwholesome. The acidity may be somewhat
      corrected by stirring in some dissolved pearlash, saleratus, or soda,
      immediately before the yeast is used; but it is better to have it good and
      fresh, without the necessity of any corrective. Yeast should always be
      kept in a cool place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who live in towns where there are breweries have no occasion to make
      their own yeast during the brewing season, and in summer they<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span> can
      every day supply themselves with fresh yeast from the baker's. It is only
      in country places where there are neither brewers or bakers that it is
      expedient to make it at home. For home-made yeast, we know the above
      receipt to be excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet cakes, buns, rusks, &amp;c., require stronger and fresher yeast than
      bread; the sugar will otherwise retard their rising.

      INDIAN BREAD OR PONE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Four quarts of indian meal sifted, a large half pint of wheat flour, a
      table-spoonful of salt, half a pint of strong fresh yeast, a quart of warm
      water. Sift into a large deep pan the indian meal and the wheat flour,
      mixing them well. Make a hole in the centre. The water must be warm, but
      not hot. Mix it with the yeast, and pour them into the hole in the midst
      of the meal. Take a spoon, and with it mix into the liquid enough of the
      surrounding meal to make a thin batter, which you must stir till it is
      quite smooth, and free from lumps. Then strew a handful of wheat flour
      over the surface, scattering it thinly, so as to cover the whole. Warm a
      clean cloth, and lay it folded over the top of the pan. Then set it in a
      warm place to rise, nearer the fire in winter than in summer. When it is
      quite light, and has risen so that the flour on the surface is cracked,
      strew on the salt, and begin to form the whole mass into a dough;
      commencing round the hole that contains the batter, and adding, gradually,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
      sufficient lukewarm water (which you must have ready for the purpose,) to
      mix it of the proper consistence. When the whole is completely mixed, and
      the batter in the centre is thoroughly incorporated with the dough, knead
      it hard for at least half an hour. Then, having formed the dough into a
      round lump in the middle of the pan, strew a little more flour thinly over
      it. Cover it, and set it again in a warm place for half an hour. Then
      flour your pasteboard, divide the dough equally, and make it into two
      loaves. Have the oven ready. Put in the loaves directly, and bake them
      about two hours or more. Indian meal requires always more baking than
      wheat. When you take them out, it is well to wrap each loaf in a clean,
      coarse towel, well sprinkled with cold water, and rolled up damp till the
      bread is baked. Having thus wrapped up the loaves, stand them on end to
      cool slowly. The damp cloths will prevent the crust from hardening too
      much while the loaves are cooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      All indian bread, and every sort of indian cake, is best when quite fresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excellent bread may be made of equal proportions of wheat, rye flour, and
      indian corn; or of three parts wheat and one part indian. All bread should
      be kept closely secluded from the air, wrapped in cloths, and put away in
      boxes or baskets with tightly-fitting lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you find the dough sour, (either from the heat of the weather, or
      from standing too long,) you may recover it, by dissolving in a little<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span> lukewarm
      water a tea-spoonful of pearlash, saleratus, or soda. Sprinkle this water
      all over the dough. Then knead it in, so that it may be dispersed
      throughout. Then put it into the oven as soon as possible; first tasting
      the dough, to discover if the sourness is entirely removed. If not, mix in
      a little more pearlash, and then taste it again. Take care not to put in
      too much of any of these alkaline substances, lest they communicate a
      disagreeable, soapy taste to the bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you buy corn meal, it will keep better if the whole is sifted as soon
      as you get it. Avoid buying much at a time, unless you can keep it in a
      very cool place. When sour, it is unfit to eat. Common indian meal is much
      the best for use.

      INDIAN RYE BREAD.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Two quarts of indian meal, two quarts of rye meal, three pints of milk or
      water, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, half a pint of strong fresh yeast.
      Having sifted the rye and indian meal in a large pan, mix them well
      together, adding the salt. Boil the milk or water in a sauce-pan, and when
      scalding hot pour it on the meal, and stir the whole very hard. If too
      stiff, add a little more warm water. Let it stand till it becomes only of
      a lukewarm heat, and then stir in the yeast. Knead the mixture into a
      stiff dough, and knead it long and hard for at least half an hour. Then
      cover the pan with a thick cloth that has been previously warmed, and set
      it near the fire to rise. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410"
      id="Page_410">[410]</a></span> the dough is quite light, and cracked all
      over the top, take it out of the pan; divide the mass in half, make it
      into two loaves, knead each loaf well for ten minutes or more, and then
      cover and set them again near the fire for about half an hour. By this
      time have the oven ready, put in the loaves directly, and bake them at
      least an hour and a half. This bread is considered very wholesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you find the dough sour, you may rectify it by kneading in a
      tea-spoonful of soda or pearlash, dissolved in a little warm water.

      BOSTON RYE AND INDIAN BREAD.&mdash;

      Two quarts of indian meal, two quarts of rye meal, half a pint of strong
      fresh yeast, half a pint of West India molasses, a small table-spoonful of
      salt. Sift the rye and indian meal into a large pan or wooden bowl; and
      mix them well together, adding a little salt. Have ready half a pint of
      water, warm but not hot. Mix with it the molasses, and then stir into it
      the yeast. Make a hole in the middle of the pan of meal, pour in<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span> the
      liquid, and then with a spoon work into it a portion of the flour that
      surrounds the hole, till the liquid in the centre becomes a thick batter.
      Sprinkle the top with rye meal, lay a thick cloth over the pan, and set it
      in a warm place to rise. In three or four hours it should be light enough
      to appear cracked all over the surface. Then pour into the middle (by
      degrees) about a pint of warm water, (it must not be hot,) and as you pour
      mix it well all through the dough, till the whole becomes a round mass.
      Sprinkle some rye flour on the dough, and having floured your hands, knead
      it long and hard, (at least half an hour, and after it ceases to stick to
      your hands,) turning it over as you proceed. Then sprinkle the dough again
      with flour, cover it, and again set it in a warm place to rise. Have the
      oven ready, and of the proper heat, so that the bread may be put in as
      soon as it has completely risen the second time. When perfectly light, the
      dough will stand high, and the surface will be cracked all over. This
      quantity will be sufficient for a common-sized loaf. Set it directly into
      the oven, and bake it about two hours. When bread has done rising, it will
      fall again if not put into the oven. As soon as it is done, wrap it
      immediately in a clean coarse towel wet with cold water, and stand it up
      on end till it is cool.

    <p>
      This is a palatable, cheap, and wholesome bread. It may be baked in a deep
      tin or iron pan.

      INDIAN MUSH.&mdash;

      Have ready on a clear fire a pot of boiling water. Stir into it, by
      degrees, (a handful at a time,) sufficient indian meal to make a very
      thick porridge, and then add a very small portion of salt, allowing not
      more than a level tea-spoonful to a quart of meal. You must keep the pot
      boiling all the time you are stirring in the meal; and between every
      handful stir hard with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413"
      id="Page_413">[413]</a></span> mush-stick, (a round stick about half a
      yard long, flattened at the lower end,) as, if not well stirred, the mush
      will be lumpy. After it is sufficiently thick and smooth, keep it boiling
      an hour longer, stirring it occasionally. Then cover the pot closely, and
      hang it higher up the chimney, or set it on hot coals on the hearth, so as
      to simmer it slowly for another hour. The goodness and wholesomeness of
      mush depends greatly on its being long and thoroughly boiled. It should
      also be made very thick. If well made, and well cooked, it is wholesome
      and nutritious; but the contrary, if thin, and not sufficiently boiled. It
      is not too long to have it three or four hours over the fire, first
      boiling, then simmering. On the contrary, it will be better for it. The
      coarser the corn meal the less cooking it requires. Send it to table hot,
      and in a deep dish. Eat it with sweet milk, buttermilk, or cream, or with
      butter and sugar, or with butter and molasses; making a hole in the middle
      of your plate of mush, putting some butter into the hole, and then adding
      the sugar or molasses.

      Cold mush that has been left may be cut into slices, or mouthfuls, and

      RYE MUSH.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      To make smooth rye mush, sift a quart or more of rye meal into a pan, and
      gradually pour in sufficient cold water to make a very thick batter,
      stirring it hard with a spoon as you proceed, and carefully pressing out
      all the lumps against the side of the pan. Add a very little salt. The
      batter must be so thick at the last that you can scarcely stir it. Then
      thin it with a little more water, and see that it is quite smooth. Rye,
      and also wheat flour, have a disposition to be more lumpy than corn meal,
      when made into mush. When thoroughly mixed and stirred, put it into a pot,
      place it over the fire and boil it well, stirring it with a mush-stick
      till it comes to a hard boil; then place it in a diminished heat, and
      simmer it slowly till you want to dish it up. Eat it warm, with butter and

      COMMON HOE-CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take an earthen or tin pan, and half fill it with coarse indian meal,
      which had best be sifted in. Add a little salt. Have ready a kettle of
      boiling water. Pour into the indian meal sufficient hot water (a little at
      a time,) to make a stiff dough, stirring it with a spoon as you proceed.
      It must be thoroughly mixed, and stirred hard. If you want the cakes for
      breakfast, mix this dough over night; cover the pan, and set it in a <i>cool</i>
      place till morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
      If kept warm, it may turn sour. Early next morning, as soon as the fire is
      burning well, set the griddle over it, and take out the dough, a handful
      at a time. Flatten and shape it by patting it with your hands, till you
      form it into cakes about the size of a common saucer, and half an inch
      thick. When the griddle is quite hot, lay on it as many cakes as it will
      hold, and bake them brown. When the upper side is done, slip a broad knife
      beneath and turn them over. They must be baked brown on both sides. Eat
      them warm, with buttermilk, sweet milk, butter, molasses, or whatever is
      most convenient. If you intend these cakes for dinner or supper, mix them
      as early in the day as you can, and (covering the pan) let them stand in a
      cool place till wanted for baking. In cold weather you may save trouble by
      mixing over night enough to last the next day for breakfast, dinner, and
      supper; baking them as they are wanted for each meal. Or they may be all
      baked in the morning, and eaten cold; but they are then not so palatable
      as when warm. They will be less liable to stick, if before each baking the
      griddle is dredged with wheat flour, or greased with a bit of fat pork
      stuck on a fork. You may cover it all over with one large cake, instead of
      several small ones.

      This cake is so called, because in some parts of America it was customary

      lump&mdash;divide it into two equal portions. Flour your pasteboard, lay
      on it the first lump of dough, and roll it out about an inch thick. Then,
      (having already heated your griddle,) lay the cake upon it, spreading it
      evenly, and make it a good round shape. It should cover the whole surface
      of the griddle, which must first be greased, either with butter or lard
      tied in a rag, or with a bit of fat fresh pork. Bake it well; and when one
      side is well browned, turn it on the other, taking care not to break it.

    <p class="hdin">
      Take equal portions of indian meal, and stewed pumpkin that has been well
      mashed and <i>drained very dry</i> in a sieve or cullender. Put the stewed
      pumpkin in a pan, and stir the meal gradually into it, a spoonful at a
      time, adding a little butter as you proceed. Mix the whole thoroughly,
      stirring it very hard. If not thick enough to form a stiff dough, add a
      little more indian meal. Make it into round, flat cakes, about the size of
      a muffin, and bake them over the fire on a hot griddle greased with
      butter. Or lay them in a square iron pan, and bake them in an oven.

      Send them to table hot, and eat them with butter.

      EXCELLENT BUCKWHEAT CAKES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      A quart of buckwheat meal, sifted; a level tea-spoonful of salt; a small
      half pint or a large handful of indian meal; two large table-spoonfuls of
      strong fresh brewer's yeast or four table-spoonfuls of home-made yeast;
      sufficient lukewarm water to make a moderate batter. Mix together the
      buckwheat and indian meal, and add the salt. Make a hole in the centre of
      the meal, and pour in the yeast. Then stir in gradually, from a kettle,
      sufficient tepid or lukewarm water to make a moderately thick batter when
      united with the yeast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422"
      id="Page_422">[422]</a></span> Cover the pan, set it in a warm place, and
      leave it to rise. It should be light in about three hours. When it has
      risen high, and is covered with bubbles, it is fit to bake. Have ready a
      clean griddle well heated over the fire. Grease it well with a bit of
      fresh butter tied in a clean white rag, and kept on a saucer near you.
      Then dip out a large ladleful of the batter, and bake it on the griddle;
      turning it when brown, with the cake-turner, and baking it brown on the
      other side. Grease the griddle slightly between baking each cake, or
      scrape it smooth with a broad knife. As fast as you bake the cakes, lay
      them, several in a pile, on a hot plate. Butter them, and if of large size
      cut them across into four pieces. Or send them to table to be buttered
      there. Trim off the edges before they go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your batter has been mixed over night, and is found sour in the
      morning, dissolve a salt-spoon of pearlash or saleratus in a little
      lukewarm water, stir it into the batter, let it stand a quarter of an
      hour, and then bake it. The alkali will remove the acidity, and increase
      the lightness of the batter. If you use soda for this purpose it will
      require a tea-spoonful.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the batter is kept at night in so cold a place as to freeze, it will be
      unfit for use. Do not grease the griddle with meat-fat of any sort.

      NICE RYE BATTER CAKES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      A quart of lukewarm milk, two eggs, a large table-spoonful<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span> of
      fresh, brewer's yeast or two of home-made yeast; sufficient sifted rye
      meal to make a moderate batter; a salt-spoon of salt; having warmed the
      milk, beat the eggs very light, and stir them gradually into it,
      alternately with the rye meal, adding the salt. Put in the meal, a handful
      at a time, till you have the batter about as thick as for buckwheat cakes.
      Then stir in the yeast, and give the batter a hard beating, seeing that it
      is smooth and free from lumps. Cover the pan, and set it in a warm place
      to rise. When risen high, and covered with bubbles, the batter is fit to
      bake. Have ready over the fire a hot griddle, and bake the cakes in the
      manner of buckwheat. Send them to table hot, and eat them with butter,
      molasses, or honey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yeast powders, used according to the directions that accompany them, and
      put in at the last, just before baking, are an improvement to the
      lightness of all batter cakes, provided that real yeast or eggs are also
      in the mixture. But it is not well to depend on the powders exclusively;
      particularly when real yeast is to be had. The lightness produced by yeast
      powders alone, is not the right sort; and though the cakes are eatable,
      they are too tough and leathery to be wholesome. As <i>auxiliaries</i> to
      genuine yeast, and to beaten eggs, yeast powders are excellent. But not as
      the sole dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indian batter cakes may be made as above; or rye and indian meal be mixed

      INDIAN CUP CAKES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      A pint and a half of yellow Indian meal; half a pint of wheat flour; a
      pint and a half of <i>sour</i> milk; (buttermilk is best;) a small
      tea-spoonful of saleratus or soda dissolved in warm water; two eggs; a
      level tea-spoonful of salt. Sift the indian and wheat meal into a pan and
      mix them well, adding the salt. If you have no buttermilk or other sour
      milk at hand, turn some sweet milk sour by setting a pan of it in the sun,
      or stirring in a spoonful of vinegar. Take out a small tea-cupful of the
      sour milk, and reserve it to be put in at the last. Beat the eggs very
      light, and then stir them, gradually, into the milk, alternately with the
      meal, a little at a time of each. Lastly, dissolve the soda or saleratus,
      and stir it into the cup of sour milk that has been reserved for the
      purpose. It will effervesce; stir it while foaming into the mixture, which
      should be a thick batter. Have ready some tea-cups, or little deep tins.
      Butter them well; nearly fill them with the batter, and set them
      immediately into a rather brisk oven. The cakes must be thoroughly baked
      all through. When done, turn them out on large plates, and send them hot
      to the breakfast or tea-table. Split them into three pieces, and eat them
      with butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soda will entirely remove the acidity of the milk, which will
      effervesce the better for being sour at first, adding therefore to the
      lightness of the cake. Taste the milk, and if you find that the slightest
      sourness remains, add a little more dissolved soda.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      All the alkalies, pearlash, saleratus, soda, and sal-volatile, will remove
      acidity, and increase lightness; but if too much is used, they will impart
      a disagreeable taste. It is useless to put lemon or orange juice into any
      mixture that is afterwards to have one of these alkalies, as they will
      entirely destroy the flavor of the fruit.

      AUNT LYDIA'S CORN CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Sift into a large pan a quart of yellow corn meal, and add a level
      tea-spoonful of salt, (not more.) Have ready a pint of boiling milk,
      sufficient to make a soft dough. Mix the milk hot into the corn meal,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span> and add
      about a quarter of a pound, or half a pint of nice fresh butter. Having
      beaten five eggs till very light and thick, stir them gradually into the
      mixture, and set it to cool. All preparations of corn meal require much
      beating and stirring. Have ready some small tin pans, about four or five
      inches square, and two or three inches deep. They are especially good for
      baking such cakes, (far better than patty-pans,) and are made by any
      tinsmith. Grease the pans with the same butter you have used in mixing the
      cakes. <i>Fill the pans to the top</i> with the above mixture, that the
      heat may immediately catch the surface, and cause it to puff up high above
      the edges of the pan. If properly mixed, and well beaten, there is no
      danger of it running over. If only half filled, and not very light, the
      mixture when baking will sink down, and become heavy and tough. Set these
      cakes immediately into a moderate oven. Bake them brown, and send them to
      the breakfast table hot. Split and butter them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They may be baked in muffin rings, but the small square pans are best.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the very best preparation of Indian cakes. If <i>exactly followed</i>,
      we believe there is none superior; as is the opinion of all persons who
      have eaten them. The cook from whom this receipt was obtained, is a
      Southern colored woman, called Aunt Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above quantities will furnish cakes only for a small family. If the
      family is of tolerable size, double the proportions of each article&mdash;as<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span> for
      instance, two quarts of Indian meal, one quart of milk, half a pound of
      butter, and ten eggs, with a level table-spoonful of salt. Let them be
      well baked; not scorched on the top, and raw at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend them highly as the perfection of corn cakes, if well made,
      well baked, and with all the ingredients of the best quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use yellow indian meal in preference to white. The yellow is sweeter, has
      more of the true corn taste, and its color shows at once what it is. The
      white has less flavor, and may be mistaken for very coarse wheat. It is
      difficult to keep corn meal good for the whole year. Before the new corn
      meal is in market, the old is apt to become musty. If you live in a city
      it is best to buy it as you want it; a few pecks at a time. If in the
      country, sift your barrel of corn meal soon after it is brought; divide
      it, and keep it in several different vessels, always well covered.

      SHORT CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      As this requires no rising, it may be mixed and prepared at half an hour's
      notice. Take a quart and a pint of wheat flour, sift it into a pan, and
      divide into three parts three quarters of a pound of nice fresh butter.
      Cut up one piece into the pan of flour, and mix it into a dough with a
      broad knife, adding, as you proceed, as little water as will be barely
      sufficient. The water must be very cold. Roll out this lump of paste,
      dredge it slightly with flour, fold it up, and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span> roll it out again. Then
      cover it with a second division of the butter, put on the sheet of paste
      with the knife, and dispersed at equal distances. Sprinkle it with flour,
      fold it, and roll out the sheet again. Put on the remainder of the butter
      as before, in bits equally dispersed. Fold, dredge, and roll out the dough
      into a rather thin sheet. Cut it into small round cakes with the edge of a
      tumbler, or something like it, using up the clippings of paste left at the
      last to make one more cake. Have ready a hot griddle or oven. Put on the
      cakes so as not to touch each other, and bake them light brown on both
      sides. Send them to table hot, to be split and buttered. Mix and roll out
      these cakes as fast as possible, and avoid handling them more than you
      need. Paste made <i>slowly</i> is never light or flakey. Mix quick and
      roll quick. This is a good plain paste for fruit pot-pies or dumplings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may make common short cake for very healthy people, with two quarts of
      flour, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and a quarter of a pound of
      lard, mixed into the pan of meal with a very little cold water, and a
      second quarter of lard spread all over the sheet of paste, after rolling
      it out. Fold, sprinkle, and roll it out again into one round griddle cake,
      or two if you have enough of dough. Take care, in baking, not to have it
      smoked or blackened at the edge. When done, cut it into "pie pieces," and
      send it to table to be split and buttered.<span class="pagenum"><a

      If you have fruit in the house ready stewed, half-moon pies can be got up
      for a plain dessert on an emergency. Either mince meat, or sausage meat,

      DELAWARE CAKES.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      This is a plain tea cake. Sift into a pan two quarts of flour. Cut up half
      a pound of fresh butter, and rub it into the flour with your hands. Beat
      five eggs very light and thick; make a hole in the centre of the flour,
      and gradually stir the beaten eggs, in turn with a pint of milk. Then add
      a jill of fine fresh yeast. Mix the whole thoroughly with a broad knife.
      Transfer it to large square tin pans. Cover it with a clean flannel, and
      set it on the hearth to rise. When it is quite light, and cracked all over
      the surface, divide the dough into cakes and bake them in muffin rings, on
      a griddle or in a stove. If baked in one large cake, there is a risk of
      their being made heavy, by cutting them when hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sweet cakes with the above mixture, add gradually to the flour in
      the pan, half a pound of powdered sugar before you rub in the butter, and
      after the eggs and milk. Stir in a wineglass of rosewater, or less, if it
      is very strong, (which rosewater seldom is) and also it loses much of its
      strength in cooking. Or, substitute the yellow rind and juice of a lemon,
      and some powdered nutmeg. They will then be a cake for company; otherwise,
      they will be for family teas.

      Either plain or sweet they are very good. We rather prefer them plain. If
      plain, omit even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
      sugar. Sugar, without other flavoring, gives plain tea cakes a faint

      This is the most laborious of cakes, and also the most unwholesome, even

      HOME-MADE BREAD.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      You cannot have good bread without good flour, good yeast, good kneading,
      and good baking, all united. Like many other things, the best flour is
      always the cheapest in the end. There is none better than that which comes
      from the mills of Hiram Smith, Rochester, New York. All flour should be
      kept in a dry place, damp being always injurious to it. Good flour goes
      farther than that of inferior quality, and is both whiter and lighter. No
      skill will avail either in making or baking bread, if the flour is of bad
      quality. Flour will keep much better if, as soon as a new barrel is
      brought in, the whole of it is sifted, and divided in several buckets.
      Flour buckets, made for the purpose, are short and wide, are broader at
      the bottom than the top, and have handles and lids. They are to be had of
      all coopers. Yeast must always be of the best quality, strong and fresh.
      With too much yeast the bread will be bitter; with too little it will be
      heavy; with stale yeast it will be heavy, sour, and dark-colored. If baked
      too little, it becomes tough and clammy. We deprecate the practice of
      putting hartshorn in bread. It gives it a bad taste; and even if it
      produces a sort of factitious lightness, it also renders it tough and
      difficult to masticate, however nice it may look. Also, it is very
      unwholesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oven should be heated in time, to set in the bread as soon as ready.
      When once it has risen to its utmost lightness, it will fall and turn sour
      if permitted to stand. The only remedy for sour<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span> bread is, to melt a
      table-spoonful of soda or pearlash in tepid water, and sprinkle it over
      the dough, which must then be kneaded again, after it has rested half an
      hour. In summer, do not begin your bread over night; it will certainly be
      sour before morning. In winter you may do so, but keep it all night in a
      warm (though not a hot) place. If the dough freezes, you may throw it away
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      To knead, double up your hands, put them deep into the dough, and work it
      with your knuckles, exerting all your strength. When the dough sticks to
      them no longer, but leaves your bent fingers clean and clear, it is time
      to cease kneading, for you have done enough for that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sift into a deep pan, or large wooden bowl, a peck of fine wheat flour,
      (adding a large table-spoonful of salt,) and mix the water with half a
      pint of strong fresh brewer's yeast, or near a whole pint if the yeast is
      home-made. Pour this into the hole, in the middle of the heap of flour.
      Mix in with a wooden spoon, a portion of the flour from the surrounding
      edges of the hole so as to make a thick batter, and having sprinkled dry
      flour over the top, let it rest for near an hour. This is called "<i>setting
      the sponge</i>," or "<i>making the leaven</i>." When it has swelled up to
      the surface, and burst through the coating of flour that covered the hole,
      pour in as much more lukewarm water as will suffice to mix the whole
      gradually into a dough. Knead it hard and thoroughly, leaving no lumps in
      it, and continue to knead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435"
      id="Page_435">[435]</a></span> till the dough leaves your hands. Throw
      over it a clean thick cloth, and set it in a warm place to rise again.
      When it is quite light and cracked all over the surface, divide it into
      loaves, and give each loaf a little more kneading, and let it rest till it
      has risen as high as it will. Have your oven quite ready, and (having
      transferred the loaves to pans, sprinkled with flour,) bake them well. Try
      the heat of the oven by previously throwing in a little flour. If it
      browns well, and you can hold your hand in the heat while you count
      twenty, it is a good temperature for bread. If the flour scorches black
      the oven is too hot, so leave the oven open a little while till it becomes
      cooler. As soon as the bread is quite done, take out the loaves, wrap each
      tightly in a clean coarse cloth, damped by sprinkling it with water, and
      stand them up on their edges. This will prevent the crust from becoming
      too hard. Keep the loaves wrapped up after they are deposited in the bread
      box.

      Dip in hot water a large square pudding cloth. Spread it out in a pan,
      dredge it well with flour, and then pour the pudding-mixture into it. Tie
      it up, making the string very secure, but leave plenty of room between the
      batter and the tying place, for the pudding to swell in boiling, at least
      one-third. Put the pudding, directly, into a large pot, and keep it
      steadily boiling for about three hours. Corn meal requires long cooking.
      Turn the pudding twice with a fork. If the water boils away too much,
      replenish it from a tea-kettle of hot water, kept boiling for the purpose.
      If you pour in <i>cold</i> water the pudding will become hard and heavy,
      and be totally spoiled. Do not turn it out and send it to table till
      wanted at dinner. Then dip it for a moment in cold water, untie the
      string, and transfer it to a dish with a cover. Eat it with molasses and
      butter; or make a sauce of drawn butter, flavored with wine and nutmeg.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pudding, if properly mixed, well beaten, and well boiled, will be as
      light as if made with eggs, (the <i>West India</i> molasses having that
      property) and it will cut down rough or open grained, like a very light
      sponge cake, unless the batter has been made too thick and stiff, and not
      sufficiently beaten, and not allowed space enough to swell in<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span> boiling.
      If made <i>too thin</i>, or not boiled well, the pudding will come out a
      soft, shapeless mass. But if all is carefully managed, this (the least
      costly of American puddings) will be found excellent for a plain table,
      and perfectly wholesome. The flavor will be much improved by adding to the
      cinnamon and ginger the grated yellow rind and juice of an orange or
      lemon. If your first attempt at this pudding is a failure, try it again&mdash;practice
      makes perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a large family, have two quarts of corn meal, two quarts of milk, and
      one quart of <i>West India</i> molasses; two table-spoonfuls of ginger,
      and one of cinnamon.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is left may be tied in a cloth, and boiled over again next day, for
      half an hour or longer.

      Too much water is injurious to any paste, rendering it tough and hard.
      Roll out the paste into a sheet, and with a broad knife spread all over it
      one-half of the lard. Sprinkle it with flour, fold it, and roll it out
      again. Spread on the remainder of the lard, dredge it slightly, fold it

      with ginger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
      cinnamon, or lemon or orange. Put on the other sheet of paste as a lid to

      Having beaten eight eggs till very thick and smooth, stir them gradually
      into a pan of milk, in turn with eight table-spoonfuls of flour, added by
      degrees. Give the whole a hard stirring at last. Dip a square pudding
      cloth into hot water, shake it out, dredge it with flour, and spread it
      over the inside of an empty pan. Pour the pudding mixture into it. Gather
      up the cloth, leaving ample space for the pudding to swell in boiling, and
      securing the string<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
      tightly. Put the pudding into a large pot of boiling water, and boil it
      fast and steadily for two hours. Turn it with a large fork once or twice
      while boiling. When done, dip it for a moment in cold water, that you may
      turn it out easily. Send it to table hot, and eat it with any sauce you
      like, from molasses, or butter and sugar, to wine sauce. This, if exactly
      followed, is the very best receipt for a plain batter pudding. It may be
      made of corn meal, or wheat bread-crumbs, (eight table-spoonfuls to eight
      eggs, and one quart of milk.) Corn meal requires with it one or two
      spoonfuls of wheat flour for this pudding.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot approve of boiling batter puddings in moulds, as they are rarely
      allowed sufficient space for swelling, and are therefore tough and solid.
      Also, it is frequently very difficult to get a hot pudding out of a mould.

      Having turned a quart of rich milk, by stirring into it a half tea-cupful
      of the water in which two or three square inches of rennet has been soaked
      for several hours, set the milk in a covered pitcher, in a warm place,
      till it becomes a firm curd, the whey separating from it, and looking thin
      and greenish. Keep it on ice till just before it is wanted for table. Then
      transfer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
      it to a large bowl, and sweeten it well with white sugar. Mix in two
      glasses of sweet wine, and grate over it a nutmeg. It is very nice with
      extract of vanilla added to the wine, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a good way to preserve a rennet by cutting it into little
      pieces, and keeping it in wine, stirring the wine into milk when you wish
      to form a curd. If turned with rennet wine, the curd will never separate
      completely from the whey, which will therefore be always thick and
      whitish. By using rennet water, the whey will be pure, thin, and of a
      light green, and the curd very white and firm. In Philadelphia market,
      dried rennets (which will keep a year or two hanging up in a cool dry
      closet) are universally used to make curds, and are always to be bought at
      small prices. They are cured by salting them, and stretching on a bent
      rod. To use this rennet, cut off a small bit, and soak it several hours,
      or over night, in a cup of lukewarm water. Then stir this water into the
      milk.

      MILK POTTAGE OR FARMER'S RICE.&mdash;

      Pick some rice, carefully removing from it the husks, and all impurities;

      that is perfectly good. Wash it through two or three waters, till it
      drains off quite clean. Stir a quarter of a pound of this rice into a
      quart of good rich milk. If the milk is poor and thin, and has been
      skimmed till it is blue, or mixed with water, the pudding will be poor
      accordingly. In the country where cream is easily to be obtained, add some
      to the milk which you use for the rice pudding. Stir in also a quarter of
      a pound of good brown sugar, and a tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Set
      the pudding into an oven, and bake till a brown skin covers the surface,
      and the rice is quite soft, which you may ascertain by lifting a bit of
      the brown skin from the edge and trying the rice. Eat it warm or cold. It

      APPLE DUMPLINGS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      For dumplings the apples should be large and juicy&mdash;pippins,
      bellflowers, or the best you can get. Small sweet apples make very poor
      dumplings. Having pared the apples, extract the cores with a tin
      apple-corer, so as to leave them smooth and whole. Why is it that so many
      families "have never had an apple corer in their house?" They cost, at the
      utmost, but twenty-five cents, are to be had at all the tinsmiths' and
      furnishing stores; and they screw out an apple core in a minute; saving
      time and trouble. The apples being ready, make a nice paste in the
      proportion of a small pint of finely-minced suet, to a large quart of
      flour; one-half of the suet rubbed into the pan of flour, (adding <i>a
      very little</i> water) the other half sliced thin, and spread all over the
      sheet of dough after it is rolled out; then folding it, and rolling it out
      again. Cut the sheet of dough in as many circular pieces as you have
      apples, allowing them large enough to close entirely over the top, and
      rolling it thick enough to hold the apple securely without danger of its
      breaking through. Put an apple on every piece of paste, and fill with
      brown sugar the hole from whence the core was taken. Squeeze on the sugar
      some fresh lemon juice, with the grated yellow rind; or, add some powdered
      nutmeg or mace, or some rose-water. This will make them very nice. They
      should be boiled in small cloths kept clean for the purpose, dipped in hot
      water, and sprinkled with flour, and room left for the dumpling to swell.
      Put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
      into a pot of boiling water, and boil them steadily for near an hour.
      Serve them up very hot, as they become heavy when cold. Eat with them
      butter and sugar, or cream sauce.

      PEACH DUMPLINGS.&mdash;

      Take large fine free-stone peaches. Peel them, cut them in half, and
      extract the stones; fill the sockets with white sugar, and put the two
      halves together. Make a nice suet paste, or, if more convenient, of
      butter, but it must be quite fresh, and very nice. Allow half a pound of
      butter to a large quart (or a pound) of sifted flour. Rub half the butter
      into the pan of flour, and make it into a dough, with a very little cold
      water. Too much water always makes tough heavy paste. Then roll the paste
      into a sheet, and put on it with a knife the remainder of the butter in
      regular bits. Fold it, roll it out again, and divide it into circular
      pieces. Lay a peach on each. Gather up the dough over the top, so as to
      form a well-shaped dumpling. Boil them in cloths for full three-quarters
      of an hour or more. Eat them with cream sauce.

      Dumplings of raspberries, or blackberries, may be made as above. Also, of

      If custards are baked in cups, set them in an iron pan half full of warm

      VERY PLAIN PIE-CRUST.&mdash;

      Sift a quart of flour into a pan. Mix together, with a knife, a quarter of
      a pound of fresh butter, and a quarter of a pound of lard, and when they
      are well blended mix them with the flour, and form them into a dough with
      as little water as possible&mdash;the water being very cold. Use ice water
      in summer. Avoid touching the paste with your hands, but use a knife
      almost entirely. If your hand is warm, do not rub butter into flour with
      it, but manage all the mixing with a knife. If you have a cool<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span> hand,
      you may rub the butter into the flour, and reserve the lard to spread all
      over the sheet of dough. Roll it out lightly. Dredge with flour, fold it,
      spread on the lard, and roll it again. Divide it into two pieces, and roll
      out each of them. Trim the edges nicely, and make them to fit your
      pie-dish. If one is for bottom crust, roll it out thinnest towards the
      centre, having for this part of the process a very small rolling-pin, but
      a finger long. Grease with lard a deep dish, or soup plate, and line it
      with the bottom crust. Fill it up with the fruit you intend for the pie,
      sweetened well with brown sugar, and heaping the fruit high in the centre.
      Cover it with a lid of paste, trim, and notch the edges neatly, and make a
      cross slit in the top; set it in the oven, and bake it steadily till it is
      a light brown. When it seems to be done, lift up a small piece at one side
      to try if the fruit is soft. Apples for pies should be pared, cored, and
      sliced very thin. If green, stew them before they are baked.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have saved enough of the dripping of roast beef, veal, or pork,
      (skimmed and put away in a covered crock) it will be good shortening for
      common pies&mdash;far superior to salt butter, and much lighter. Salt
      renders pastry hard and heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never use suet for <i>baked</i> paste. It is only for dumplings and
      pot-pies. Bread dough, or any dough made with yeast, is not good when
      boiled, becoming tough and leathery, and being very unwholesome.

    <p>
      Except in very plain country places a fruit pie,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span> with two crusts, (under and
      upper) is now seen but rarely. <i>Meat</i> pies, or birds, however, should
      have two crusts. The gravy is a great improvement to the under one.
      English people usually make their fruit pies with a top-crust only,
      putting a turned down tea-cup under the centre of the lid to collect the
      juice, (of course removing the cup when the pie is cut.) It is a good
      method in a country where the cost of flour is high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much economy in the shortening will infallibly make the crust very
      poor, hard, heavy, and unwholesome. If you cannot afford dessert paste, do
      not attempt pies at all; but substitute a plain charlotte, or slices of
      bread and butter, covered with stewed fruit, sweetened, and laid in a deep
      dish.

      leaving out the stones. Of cherries, take the large red juicy pie
      cherries. Black cherries, (when baked) go all to stones, and they are not
      worth the trouble of cooking, though very good when eaten from the trees.
      Currants must be carefully stripped from the stems, and made very sweet.

      Sift into a deep pan a quart and a pint of the best superfine flour. Have
      ready (set on ice, and covered with a thick double cloth) a pound of the
      very best fresh butter. When you want to use it, cut it into four
      quarters. Cut one quarter into very little bits, and with a broad knife
      mix it well into the flour, adding, by degrees, a very little water, no
      more than half a tumbler. Some flour, however, requires more water than
      others. Avoid touching the dough with your hands, in case they should be
      warm. Take out the lump of dough, dredge it with flour, and lay it on your
      pasteboard. Keep on a plate near you a little extra flour for sprinkling
      and rolling. Roll out the sheet of dough very thin, having floured the
      rolling-pin to prevent its sticking. Place, with a knife, the second
      quarter of butter in little bits all over the sheet of paste, at equal
      distances. Then fold it square, (covering the butter with the corners of
      paste) dredge it, and roll it out again to receive the third quarter of
      butter. Repeat this again, till all the butter is in; always rolling very
      fast, and pressing on <i>lightly</i>. You will see, towards the last, the
      paste puffing into little blisters all over the surface; a sign of
      success. When the last layer of butter is all in, roll the whole into a
      large sheet; roll it round like a scroll, and put it<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span> away in a cold place, but
      not so cold as to freeze it, for it will then be spoiled. When you are
      ready for it bring it out, cut it down, and roll out each piece ready for

      a time. Have ready a square pudding-cloth, scalded and floured. Pour in
      the mixture, and tie the cloth tightly, but not closely, as room must be
      left for the pudding to swell in boiling. Put it into a pot of hot water,
      and boil it steadily for two hours. Send wine sauce to table with it&mdash;or
      cold sauce, of beaten butter, and sugar, and nutmeg.

      PLAIN PLUM PUDDING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is for a small plain-living family. Chop very fine half a<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span> pound of
      nice fresh beef suet. Stone a half pound of very good raisins, or use the
      sultana or seedless sort. Dredge them well on all sides with flour to
      prevent their sinking to the bottom. Grate the yellow rind of a large
      fresh lemon, and strain the juice into the saucer on which you have grated
      the rind. It will be still better if you use the rind and juice of an
      orange as well as of a lemon. Put into a bowl half a pint of grated
      bread-crumbs, and a heaped table-spoonful of flour, and pour on them a
      half pint of boiling milk. Beat in a shallow pan four eggs till very thick
      and light. Mix the suet gradually into the bread, adding alternately the
      beaten egg, (a little at a time) the lemon and orange, and four heaped
      table-spoonfuls of sugar. Lastly, stir in by degrees, the raisins, well
      floured. Put the mixture into a square pudding-cloth spread out into a
      deep pan, and dipped in boiling water. Tie it securely, leaving room to
      swell. Boil it three hours.

      THE BEST PUFF-PASTE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      To a pound of the best fresh butter allow a pound of the finest flour,
      sifted into a deep pan. Have on a plate some additional sifted flour for
      sprinkling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
      rolling in. Divide the pound of butter into four equal parts, and three of
      those parts divide again into two portions. Mix the first quarter of
      butter into the mass of flour, cutting it with a broad-bladed knife. If
      your hands are naturally warm, avoid touching the dough with them, as
      their heat will render it heavy. Paste, to be very good, should be made on
      a marble slab. All well-furnished kitchens or pastry rooms should be
      provided with marble-topped tables, and marble mortars. Add gradually to
      the lump of dough a <i>very little cold</i> water, barely sufficient to
      moisten it with the first quarter of butter, and mix it well with the aid
      of the broad knife; but proceed as fast as you can, and do not work with
      it too long. Too much water will render it tough, and too much working
      will make it heavy. Then sprinkle the marble slab with some of the spare
      flour, take the lump of paste from the pan, and roll it out into a sheet.
      Divide one of the portions of butter into little bits, and with the knife
      disperse them equally all over the sheet of paste. Then sprinkle it again
      with flour, fold it up so as to cover the butter, and roll it out again.
      Proceed in this manner till you have got in all the butter, rolling always
      lightly, and you will soon see the surface of the dough puffing up in
      little blisters, a sign that it is becoming light. Besides the first
      mixing in the lump, the butter will then be put in with what are called
      six turns. When baked, you will see that every turn makes a layer or
      sheet. If you choose to multiply them, you may make nine<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span> sheets.
      We have seen twelve. All this must be done fast and lightly. Then put away
      the paste to cool for ten minutes before arranging it in the dishes. This
      quantity will make two pies or four tarts. In baking, let the oven be hot,
      and keep up a steady heat, so the paste may not fall after it has first
      risen. When pale brown, it is done.

      SHELLS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      For shells take the best puff paste, and line with it large deep plates,
      the size of a soup-plate. They should have broad rims. Notch the edges of
      the paste handsomely with a sharp penknife, and be careful not to plaster
      on, afterwards, any bits by way of mending or rectifying an error. When
      baked, every patch in the border will show itself plainly. Bake the shells
      entirely empty, till pale brown all over. When cool fill them, <i>quite up
      the top</i>, with whatever marmalade or stewed fruit you have prepared for
      the purpose. In this way (baking them empty,) the shells are thoroughly
      done, and not clammy and heavy at the bottom, as they always are when
      filled <i>before</i> baking. The fruit requires no other cooking, having
      been done once already. Sift white sugar over the surface. If for company
      whip some cream, sweeten it, and flavor it with lemon, orange, pine-apple,
      strawberry or vanilla, and pile it on the surface of the shell before it
      goes to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small tarts may, in this way, be baked empty, for patty-pans, and filled
      with ripe fruit, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472"
      id="Page_472">[472]</a></span> strawberries, raspberries, or grated
      pine-apple, made very sweet, and creamed on the top&mdash;or you may fill
      the shells with any sort of sweetmeats, either preserves or marmalade, or
      with mince-meat. Shells may be made thus, and filled with stewed oysters,
      or reed-birds, cooked previously, and served up warm; or with
      nicely-dressed lobster. You may make lids for them of the same paste baked
      by itself on a shallow plate, and when taken off fitting well as a cover
      to put on afterwards before sending to table.

      BORDERS OF PASTE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      These are made of fine puff-paste cut into handsome patterns, or wreaths
      of leaves or flowers. They are laid round the broad edge of the deep plate
      that contains a rich pudding, such as lemon, orange, almond, cocoa-nut,
      pine-apple, &amp;c.; the dish being full down to the bottom and up to the
      top, and having no paste but the border round the edge. They must be baked
      in the dish on which they come to table, and not in tin or iron, as the
      pudding cannot be transferred. At handsome tables, a pudding baked with a
      paste <i>under</i> it (lining the dish,) is now seen but seldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of wreaths, you may make a puff-paste border by laying a thick
      evenly cut band of paste round the flat rim of the dish, and notching it,
      forming with a penknife small squares about an inch wide, and turning one
      square up and one square down alternately, <i>cheveux de frize</i>
      fashion. Or you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
      may make the squares near two inches wide and turn over one corner sharp,
      leaving the other flat. This looks pretty when baked, if the paste is <i>very

      LEMON PUDDING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      To make two puddings take two fine large ripe lemons, and rub them under
      your hand on a table. Grate off the thin yellow rind upon a large lump of
      loaf sugar. Cut the lemon, and squeeze the juice into a saucer through a
      strainer, to avoid the seeds. Put half a pound of powdered white sugar
      into a deep earthen pan, (including the sugar on which you have rubbed the
      lemons) and cut up in it half a pound of the best fresh butter, adding the
      juice. Stir them to a light cream with a wooden spaddle, which is shorter
      than a mush-stick, and flattened at one end; that end rather thin, and
      rather broad. Beat in a shallow pan, (with hickory rods) six eggs, till
      very thick and smooth, and stir them gradually into the mixture. Have
      ready some of the best puff-paste, made in the proportion of a pint or
      half a pound of very nice fresh butter to a pint or half a pound of sifted
      flour. Take china or white-ware dishes with broad rims. Butter the rim,
      and lay round it neatly a border of the paste. <i>Put no paste inside the
      dish beneath the mixture.</i> Fill each dish to the top with the pudding
      mixture, and set it immediately into the oven. It will bake in about half
      an hour When done, and browned on the surface, set it to<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span> cool,
      and send it to table in the dish it was baked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine puddings are now made without an under crust, but merely a handsome
      border of puff-paste laid round the edge, and helped with the pudding.
      Sift sugar over the surface. This quantity will make one large pudding, or
      two small ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      To almost all puddings the flavor of lemon or orange is an improvement. A
      genuine <i>baked</i> lemon pudding, (such as was introduced by the justly
      celebrated Mrs. Goodfellow,) and is well known at Philadelphia dinner
      parties, must have <i>no flour</i> or bread whatever. The mixture only of
      butter, sugar, and eggs, (with the proper flavoring) and when baked it
      cuts down smooth and shining, like a nice custard. Made this way, they are
      among the most delicious of puddings; but, of course, are not intended for
      children or invalids. We have already given numerous receipts for <i>plain</i>
      family desserts. In this <i>chapter</i> the receipts are "for company."
      The author was <i>really</i> a pupil of Mrs. Goodfellow's, and for double
      the usual term, and while there took notes of every thing that was made,
      it being the desire of the liberal and honest instructress that her
      scholars <i>should learn in reality</i>.

      ALMOND PUDDING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Blanch in hot water a quarter of a pound of shelled sweet and two ounces
      of bitter almonds, and as you blanch them throw them into a bowl of cold
      water. When all are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
      thus peeled, take them out singly, wipe them dry in a clean napkin, and
      lay them on a plate. Pound them one at a time in a marble mortar till they
      become a smooth paste, adding frequently a few drops of rose-water to make
      them light and preserve their whiteness, mixing the bitter almonds with
      the sweet. As you pound them, take out the paste and lay it in a saucer
      with a tea-spoon. Without the rose-water they will become oily and
      dark-colored. Without a few bitter almonds the others will be insipid. The
      almonds may be thus prepared a day before they are wanted for use. Cut up
      a large quarter of a pound of fresh butter in a large quarter of a pound
      of powdered sugar, and stir them together with a spaddle till very light
      and creamy. Add a large wine-glass of mixed wine and brandy, and half a
      grated nutmeg. Beat, till they stand alone, the whites only of six eggs,
      and stir them gradually into the butter and sugar, in turn with the
      pounded almonds. Stir the whole very hard at the last. Put the mixture
      into a deep dish with a broad rim, and fill it up to the top, laying a
      border of puff-paste all round the rim. Serve up the pudding cool, having
      sifted sugar over it.

      jelly. Then fill up the dish, and set it, a few minutes in a rather cool

      You may flavor the meringue with vanilla. Split, and break up a small

      vanilla flavor is extracted, the cream tasting of it strongly. Then strain
      it well, and mix the vanilla cream with the white of egg. Or, a little <i>home-made</i>

      breaking up some vanilla beans, and steeping them for a week or two in a
      bottle of <i>absolute</i> alcohol; then straining the liquid, transferring
      it to a clean bottle, and keeping it closely corked. Very little of what
      is called "Extract of Vanilla" is good, and it is more expensive than to

      or marmalade, and boil it ten minutes in a sauce-pan, stirring it well.
      Take it up and set it away to cool. When cold, fill with it the baked
      shells. Fill them up to the top with the mixture, and before they go to
      table sift powdered white sugar over the surface of the puddings.<span

      CHEESE PUDDING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take a quarter of a pound of excellent cheese; rich, but not strong or
      old. Cut it in small bits, and then beat it (a little at a time) in a
      marble mortar. Add a quarter of a pound of the best fresh butter. Cut it
      up, and pound it in the mortar with the cheese, till perfectly smooth and
      well mixed. Beat five eggs till very thick and smooth. Mix them,
      gradually, with the cheese and butter. Put the mixture into a deep dish
      with a rim. Have ready some puff-paste, and lay a broad border of it all
      round the edge, ornamenting it handsomely. Set it immediately into a
      moderate oven, and bake it till the paste is browned, and has risen very
      high all round the edge of the dish. Sift white sugar over it before it
      goes to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is intended that the cheese taste shall predominate. But, if preferred,
      you may make the mixture very sweet by adding powdered sugar; it may be
      seasoned with nutmeg and mace. Either way is good.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be baked in small patty-pans, lined at the bottom and sides with
      puff-paste. Remove them from the tins as soon as they come out of the
      oven, and place them on a large dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pudding is very nice made of rich fresh cream cheese; the rind, of
      course, being pared off. Cream cheese pudding will require sugar and spice&mdash;that
      is, a heaped tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon, all
      mixed; two ounces of fresh butter, and six eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a

      FLORENDINES.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      These are made of any sort of fruit, stewed in its own juice or in
      sweetmeat syrup, but when practicable, without any water. A pint of this
      fruit is mixed with half a pint of fresh butter, and half a pint of
      powdered sugar stirred together to a light cream, and then mixed with
      three well-beaten eggs, and the fruit stirred in alternately with the
      beaten butter and sugar. Have ready baked shells of puff-paste, ready to
      be filled with the mixture. The fruit may be apples, quinces, peaches,
      gooseberries, currants, raspberries. Cranberries, gooseberries, and
      currants, require additional sugar, as they are naturally very sour. If
      you use plums or cherries for any sort of cooking, stone them first.

      PEACH PIES.&mdash;

      Take a sufficient number of fine juicy freestone peaches. Clingstones are
      very hard and insipid when raw, and still more tasteless when cooked. Peel
      the peaches and quarter them, having removed the stones. Stew them in
      their own juice, and while hot make them very sweet with white sugar. When
      you put them to stew, place among them a bunch of fresh green peach
      leaves, to be removed when the peaches are done. Or, cook with them some
      peach kernels, blanched in hot water, to be picked out when the stewing is
      finished. Peach leaves or kernels communicate a flavor which to most
      persons is pleasant. Have ready some puff-paste shells; baked, and
      beginning to cool. Fill them to the top with<span class="pagenum"><a

      A FRUIT CHARLOTTE.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      Have ready a large fresh almond sponge cake, or lady cake. Cut a round or
      circular piece to fit the bottom of a great glass bowl. Also, about twelve
      or fourteen oblong slices, to stand up all round to line the sides. Have
      ready two quarts or more of ripe strawberries or raspberries. Mash the
      fruit to a jam, and having made it very sweet with white sugar, spread it
      thickly over the pieces of cake. Lay the circular piece of cake in the
      bottom of the bowl and stand up the others all round the sides, all close
      to each other or wrapping over a little. Proceed to fill the bowl with the
      fruit; and when half way up, put on another layer of sliced cake spread
      with fruit. Then fill up with fruit to the top. Have ready a quart of
      whipped cream flavored with vanilla or bitter almonds. Heap it high on the
      bowl, and set it in a cool place till it goes to table. This is a very
      fine article for a nice dessert, and can be prepared at a short notice,
      and without going down stairs, as it requires no cooking.

    <p>
      For the whipped cream, you may pile the bowl with any sort of white

      VANILLA CUSTARDS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Split a vanilla bean, break it into small bits, and boil it in a half pint
      of milk, till all the flavor of the vanilla is extracted. Strain it
      through a very fine strainer, cover it, and set it aside. Boil a quart of
      rich milk, and when it comes to a boil set it away to cool. Beat eight
      eggs till very thick and smooth, (and when the milk is cold) add that
      which is flavored with vanilla, and stir it in gradually with a quarter of
      a pound of powdered white sugar. Divide the mixture in custard cups,
      (filling them to the top) and set them into an iron bake-pan filled with
      boiling water, reaching nearly to the the rim of the cups. Put them into a
      moderate oven, and bake them a pale brown. When cool, grate nutmeg, or lay
      a maccaroon on the top over each. Never send custards warm to table. If
      well made, and baked not too much, there will be no whey at the bottom of
      the cups, and the custards will be smooth and firm all through, and have
      no spongy holes in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make soft custards, omit the whites of all the eggs, and have a double
      quantity of yolks. The whites may be used for almond or cocoa-nut pudding,
      for lady cake, for meringue or icing, and for kisses or maccaroons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Orange Custards.</i>&mdash;Prepare four large ripe<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span> oranges, by rolling them
      under your hand on a table to increase the juice. Use none of the peel for
      these custards, but reserve it for something else. Beat in a shallow pan
      twelve eggs till thick and smooth. Mix the orange juice with a wineglass
      of cold water, and stir it gradually into the beaten egg, with a small
      tumblerful of powdered sugar. There is no milk in these custards. Divide
      them into custard cups, and beat them ten minutes. When cold, grate nutmeg
      over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lemon Custard</i>&mdash;Is made in the above manner, with the juice of
      four large lemons, (omitting the rind) a small wineglass of cold water,
      twelve beaten eggs, and a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar. Any of
      these fine custards may be boiled in a <i>bain-marie</i>, with water in
      the outside kettle, and there is no way better. When boiled and cool,
      grate in some nutmeg, and serve up the custard in a glass or china
      pitcher, with saucers of the same to eat it from, or divide it in small
      glass cups with handles to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemon or orange custards are very fine. They are made without milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Chocolate Custard.</i>&mdash;Make some strong chocolate, allowing a
      quarter of a pound of the best, (which is Baker's prepared cocoa) to a
      quart of rich milk; first mixing the milk and scraped chocolate to a
      smooth paste. Boil them together a quarter of an hour. While warm, stir in
      two or three table-spoonfuls of loaf sugar. Then set it away to cool. Have
      ready eight well-beaten eggs, and stir them gradually into the chocolate.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span> Bake the
      mixture in cups, and serve them up with a chocolate maccaroon laid on the
      top of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Almond and Maccaroon Custard.</i>&mdash;Boil in half a pint of rich
      milk a handful of <i>bitter</i> almonds, blanched and broken up. When
      highly flavored, strain that milk and set it aside. Boil a quart of milk
      by itself, and when cold stir in, gradually, eight well beaten eggs,
      adding the flavored milk, and half a pint of powdered sugar. Stir the
      whole very hard at the last. Bake it in cups, and when done and cold, lay
      on the top of each a maccaroon with four others placed around it; five
      maccaroons to each custard. Or, if the maccaroons are made in the house,
      let every one be large enough to cover the top of the custard like a lid.

      FINE PLUM PUDDING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This pudding is best when prepared, (all but the milk and eggs,) the day
      before it is wanted. Seed and cut in half one pound of the best bloom
      raisins; and pick, wash, and dry before the fire, a pound of Zante
      currants, (commonly called plums.) Dredge the fruit well with flour, to
      prevent its sinking or clogging. Take one pound of fresh beef suet, freed
      from the skin and strings, and chopped <i>very fine</i>; a pint of grated
      bread-crumbs, and half a pint of sifted flour; a large quarter of a pound
      of the best sugar, a large table-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon
      mixed, and two powdered nutmegs&mdash;all the spice steeped in a half pint
      of mixed wine and brandy. Put away these<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span> ingredients separately,
      closely covered, and let them stand undisturbed all night. Next morning
      proceed to finish the pudding, which requires at least six hours boiling.
      Beat nine eggs till very thick and smooth, then add gradually a pint of
      rich milk, in turn with the bread-crumbs and flour. Mix with the sugar the
      grated yellow rind and juice of two large lemons or two oranges, and add
      gradually to the mixture all the ingredients, stirring very hard. If you
      find it too thick, add by degrees some more milk; if too thin, some more
      bread-crumbs. But take care not to have too much bread or flour, or the
      pudding will be solid and heavy. Dip a large strong cloth in boiling
      water; shake it out, and spread it in a large pan. Dredge it lightly with
      flour, and pour in the mixture. Tie it tightly, but leave sufficient space
      for the pudding to swell in boiling. Put it into a pot of fast-boiling
      water, and boil it steadily six hours or more, not taking it up till
      wanted for table. Before turning it, dip the cloth for a moment in cold
      water to make the pudding come out easily. Have ready some slips of citron
      or of blanched sweet almonds, or both, and stick them, liberally, all over
      the surface of the pudding after you have dished it. Serve it up with wine
      sauce highly flavored, or with butter and sugar beaten to a cream, and
      seasoned with nutmeg and rose. Do not set the pudding on fire to burn out
      the liquor; that practice has had its day, and is over. It was always
      foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to send it to a distant place, (for<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span> instance, to some part of
      the world where plum puddings are not known or not made) you may preserve
      it, (after boiling it well,) by leaving it tied up in the cloth it was
      cooked in; hanging it up in a cool dry place, and then packing it well in
      a tin vessel having a close fitting cover. Paste a band of thick white
      paper all around the place where the lid shuts down, and put into a tight
      box the vessel that contains the pudding. When it arrives at its
      destination, the friend who receives it will pare off thinly the outside,
      and tying up the pudding in a fresh clean cloth, will boil it over again
      for an hour or more; and when done the surface may be then decorated with
      slips of citron or almond. It has been said that in this way a plum
      pudding can be kept for <i>six</i> months, as good as ever. It cannot. But
      it may keep six <i>weeks</i>. Do not <i>fry</i> or <i>broil</i> plum
      pudding that is left at dinner. The slices will be greasy and heavy. But
      tie the piece that remains in a small cloth, and <i>boil</i> it over again
      for an hour. It will then be nearly as good as on the first day. Believe
      in no wonders that you hear, of the long keeping of either plum pudding,
      plum cake, or mince meat, which are all of the same family. However long
      they may be preserved from absolute decomposition, these things are always
      best when fresh.

      MINCE PIES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The best mince meat is made of fresh beef's tongue boiled, peeled, and
      when quite cold, chopped very fine. The next best is<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span> of beef's heart boiled and
      chopped. The next of cold roast beef. And the next, of the lean of cold
      boiled beef, quite fresh, and cooked especially for the purpose. All the
      meat must be fresh, and not minced till entirely cold. To two large pounds
      of lean meat allow two small pounds of nice kidney suet, cleared from skin
      and strings, and chopped very small; two pounds of fine juicy apples,
      pared, cored, and minced; two pounds of Zante currants, washed, and picked
      clean; two pounds of fine bloom raisins, seeded and chopped, or of
      seedless sultana raisins cut in half; two pounds of the best sugar; two
      large nutmegs, powdered; a table-spoonful of ground cinnamon; the same
      quantity of ground ginger, with the juice and grated yellow rind of six
      large lemons, or the juice of six oranges, and their grated rind; a pint
      of Madeira or sherry, and half a pint of brandy; lastly, half a pound of
      citron cut into slips, rather large. If the citron is chopped small it
      cannot be distinguished among the other ingredients, and its flavor is
      lost. When all is prepared, mix well in a large pan the chopped meat,
      suet, and fruit. Then, gradually add the spice, having steeped it in the
      liquor all the preceding night, mixing the whole thoroughly, and putting
      in the citron at the last. Line with fine puff-paste deep pie-dishes, or
      patty-pans. Fill them, quite full of the mince, heaping it higher towards
      the centre; and put on a lid, handsomely decorated with puff-paste
      ornaments, and having a cross slit in the centre surrounded with paste
      leaves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
      flowers. Set the pies immediately into a moderately brisk oven, and bake
      them a light brown. Eat them warm. If baked the preceding day, heat them
      again before they go to table. The foolish custom of setting the pies on
      fire after they come to table, and causing a blue blaze to issue from the
      liquor that is in them, is now obsolete, and considered ungenteel and
      tavern-like. If this practice originated in a polite desire to <i>frighten
      the ladies</i>, its purpose is already a failure, for the ladies are not
      frightened; that is, not really.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mincemeat will taste more fresh and pleasant if the apples are not added
      till the day the pies are made. It should be kept well-secured from air
      and damp, in stone jars closely covered. Whenever a jar is opened to take
      out some for immediate use, pour in a large glass or two of brandy, and
      stir it about. It is not true that mincemeat will keep all winter, even by
      this preservative. It is sure to become musty (or worse,) before two
      months. It is best to make fresh mincemeat at least three times during the
      season. When the cold weather is over, do not attempt it, unless a little
      for immediate use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mincemeat, with a double portion of excellent raisins, (cut in half,) will
      do very well without currants, which are very troublesome to prepare; and
      those imported of late years are rarely of good quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard of West India mincemeat made with cold roast turkey; chopped
      pine-apple; grated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
      cocoa-nut; preserved ginger chopped, and moistened with its own syrup; and
      seasoned with nutmeg and noyau.

      CALF'S FEET JELLY.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Select the largest and best calf's feet. Four is called a set. Choose
      those that, after the hair has been well scalded and scraped off, are
      prepared with the skins left on. There is much glutinous substance in the
      skin itself, therefore it adds to the strength and firmness of the jelly.
      The feet being made perfectly clean, split them upwards as far as you can,
      and put them to boil in a gallon of <i>very clear</i> soft water. Boil
      them till they have all gone to pieces, and the flesh is reduced to rags,
      and the liquid to one half. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve into a
      white-ware pan, and set it away to cool. When quite cold, it should be a
      cake of firm jelly. Take it out, and scrape from it all the fat at the top
      and sediment at the bottom. Press on the surface, some clean blotting
      paper, to remove any grease that may yet remain about it. Cut the cake of
      jelly into pieces, and put it into a <i>very clean</i> porcelain kettle,
      with a large pint of sherry, (inferior wine will spoil it,) a pound of the
      best loaf sugar, broken small; the yellow rind of six lemons, pared so
      thin as to be transparent, and their juice squeezed over the sugar through
      a strainer; the <i>whites</i> of six or seven eggs, with their shells
      mashed small. If the jelly is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492"
      id="Page_492">[492]</a></span> moulded, add a quarter ounce of the best
      Russia isinglass. Boil together all these ingredients for near twenty
      minutes. Then take it off the fire, and let it stand undisturbed for about
      five minutes, to settle. Next, have ready a pointed jelly bag, made of
      clean white flannel. Spread it open, suspended by strings to a table edge.
      Set a large tureen or white-ware pan beneath it, and let the jelly drip as
      long as it will; but on no account squeeze or press the bag, as that will
      spoil all, rendering the whole jelly cloudy or streaked. If it is not
      quite clear at the first straining, empty the contents of the bag into a
      basin, wash the bag clean, hang it up again, pour the jelly back, wash the
      tureen or pan, and let the jelly pass into it again. Repeat this straining
      if necessary. When quite clear, shape the jelly in white-ware moulds,
      which have been setting two hours in cold water. When the jelly is wanted,
      wrap round the moulds for a moment, a cloth dipped in warm water, and turn
      it out on glass dishes. The ingredients that are left in the bag may be
      boiled and strained over again for children. If the jelly is <i>not</i> to
      be moulded, you may omit the isinglass. In that case break it up, and
      serve it in a glass bowl. It is now the general opinion that jellies have
      a more lively taste when broken up, from the numerous acute angles they
      present to the tongue and palate. We think this opinion correct; and also
      they look brighter and more glittering, and <i>go farther</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Apple Jelly</i>&mdash;Is far less expensive than that of calf's feet,
      and if well made looks beautifully. It<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span> requires the very best and
      most juicy apples, (for instance, two dozen large pippins or
      bell-flowers.) Wash and wipe them well, (removing all blemishes,) pare,
      core, and slice or quarter them. Put them into a <i>bain-marie</i> or
      double kettle, with the water outside, and let them boil till broken and
      dissolved, putting in with them the grated yellow rind of four large
      lemons. Press and mash the stewed apples through a very clean sieve, till
      you have extracted all the juice. Measure it while warm, and allow to each
      quart a pound of the finest powdered and sifted loaf sugar well mixed in,
      and the juice of the lemons. Transfer it to a clean white flannel jelly
      bag, and let it drip into a large white-ware pan. When quite clear, put it
      into moulds, and set it on ice to congeal. When wanted, turn it out of the
      moulds, (loosened by wrapping round their outsides cloths dipped a minute
      in warm water) and serve it up in glass dishes.

      <i>Siberian Jelly.</i>&mdash;A fine pink-colored jelly may be made in the
      above manner, of the red Siberian crab-apple, but it requires an <i>additional</i>
      quarter of a pound of sugar to a pint of juice. Instead of lemon you may
      flavor it, (after all the juice has done dripping) by mixing with extract
      of rose, or strong rose-water, allowing a wine-glassful to each quart of
      jelly. Rose-water, or extract of rose, evaporates so speedily when over
      the fire, that it should never be added till the very last.

      <i>Orange Jelly</i>&mdash;Is made in the proportion of a pint of strained
      orange juice to a pound of loaf sugar, boiled with an ounce of isinglass,

      has first been melted over the fire by itself in a very little water. Add
      the <i>yellow</i> rind of the oranges pared from the white as thin as
      possible. Give it one boil up, and strain it into the jelly-bag. When
      clear, transfer it to moulds. Twelve large oranges will generally yield a
      pint of juice. Lemon jelly is made in the same manner, but with more
      sugar.

      CURRANT JELLY.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The currants should be large, fine, and fully ripe. The best and sweetest
      currants grow in the shade; and the largest, also. If exposed to the full
      heat of our American sun, it turns them sour, dries up the juice, and
      withers their growth. Gather them when fully ripe, strip them from the
      stems into a cullender, and wash and drain them. Transfer them to a large
      pan, and mash them well with a wooden beetle. Then put the currants, with
      their juice, into a <i>bain-marie</i> or double kettle, and cook them with
      the water outside, stirring them hard to bring out the juice. Simmer them
      for a quarter of an hour, and then transfer them to a very clean sieve,
      and press them over a pan till no more juice appears. Measure the juice,
      and to each pint allow a pound of broken-up loaf sugar. Mix the sugar with
      the juice, put all into a porcelain kettle, and boil it till the scum
      ceases to rise. If the sugar is of excellent quality, (the best
      double-refined should be used for all nice sweetmeats) it will need but
      little skimming, and leave no sediment when poured off.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span> Boil it
      twenty minutes with the sugar. To try if it is done, take up a spoonful
      and hold it out in the open air. If it congeals very soon, it is cooked
      enough. Put it warm into glass tumblers. Cut out some white tissue paper
      into double rounds, exactly fitting the glasses. Press these papers
      lightly on the surface of the jelly; and, next day, tie over the top thick
      papers dipped in brandy, and set them in the sun all that day if the
      weather is bright and warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All jellies of small fruit may be made in a similar manner; first boiling
      the fruit by itself, and mashing it to get out all the juice. Then boiling
      the berries again, <i>with the sugar</i>, for about twenty minutes. The
      above receipt is equally good for grapes, blackberries, and gooseberries.
      Black currant jelly (excellent for sore throats,) requires but three
      quarters of a pound of sugar, the juice being very thick of itself.
      Peaches, plums, damsons, and green gages, must be scalded, peeled, and
      stoned, before boiling for jelly, and they require, at least, a pound and
      a half of sugar to a pint of juice. It is better to preserve them as
      marmalade than as jelly. Strawberries and raspberries require no previous
      cooking; mash out the juice, strain it, allow a pound of sugar to every
      pint of juice, and then boil them together (skimming carefully) for about
      a quarter of an hour, or till they congeal on being tried in the air.<span

      WINE JELLY.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Wine jellies are seldom made except for company. The wine must be of
      excellent quality; either port, madeira, or champagne. To a quart of wine
      allow a pound of the best double-refined loaf sugar, and an ounce of the
      best Russian isinglass. Melt the sugar (broken small) in the wine. Melt
      the isinglass by itself in as much warm water as will just cover it, and
      when quite dissolved, stir it into the mixed wine and sugar. Boil all
      together, till on trial it becomes a firm jelly, which will be very soon.
      If it does not congeal well, add some more dissolved isinglass, and more
      sugar. Serve in moulds, and eat it on saucers. Jelly is made in this
      manner of any nice sort of <i>liqueur</i> or cordial. Also of strong green
      tea, or very strong coffee; first made as usual, and then boiled with loaf
      sugar and isinglass till they congeal. We do not recommend them, except as
      some exhilaration to the fatigue of a party.

      TRIFLE.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      This is a very nice and very elegant party dish, and is served in a large
      glass bowl. Put into the bottom of the bowl a pound of bitter almond
      maccaroons. Pour on sufficient madeira or sherry to dissolve them. Let
      them soak in it till soft and broken. Have ready a very rich custard,
      flavored with vanilla bean (broken up and boiled by itself in a little
      milk), and then strained into the quart of milk prepared for the custard,
      which should be of ten eggs, (<i>using only the yolks</i>)<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span> and
      sweetened with a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar. It is best and
      easiest to <i>bake</i> the custard. It will be very rich and soft with
      yolk of egg only. When the custard is cold lay it on the dissolved
      maccaroons. Then add a thick layer of very nice marmalade. Rub off the
      yellow rind of a large lemon or two on some pieces of loaf sugar, and add
      to it some powdered sugar mixed with the lemon juice. Whip to a strong
      froth a large quart (or more) of rich cream, gradually mixing with it the
      lemon and sugar. Lastly, pile up the frothed cream high on the glass bowl,
      and keep it on ice till it is sent to table. Instead of lemon you may
      flavor the whipt cream with rose-water; it will require, if not very
      strong, a wine-glassful. To give the cream a fine pink color, tie up some
      alkanet chips in a thin muslin bag; lay the bag to infuse in a tea-cup of
      plain cream, and then add the pink infusion to the quart of cream as you
      froth it.

      BLANCMANGE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The best and finest blancmange is made with a set of calves' feet, (singed
      but not skinned) boiled slowly in a gallon of water till the meat drops
      from the bone; then strain it, and set it away till next day, in a broad
      white-ware pan. Skim it well while boiling. Next day it should be a solid
      cake of clear jelly. Scrape off all the fat and sediment from the outside,
      cut the jelly into small bits, and melt it over again. Boil in a porcelain
      kettle a pint of cream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498"
      id="Page_498">[498]</a></span> and when it has come to a boil, stir in six
      ounces of loaf sugar, and whatever you intend for flavoring; either the
      milk, in which a handful of bitter almonds has been boiled, (first being
      blanched and broken up) or a vanilla bean split and cut to pieces, and
      boiled in a little milk and strained. Or, it may be mixed with three
      ounces of chocolate, (Baker's prepared cocoa is the best) scraped fine.
      When the flavoring has had a boil with the sugar, stir into it, gradually,
      the melted jelly, and transfer it to white-ware moulds that have set in
      cold water, and are still damp. Stir it well, and when the blancmange is
      thickening, and becoming hard to stir, set the moulds on ice, or in pans
      of cold water in the cellar, and cease stirring. When quite congealed, dip
      the moulds in lukewarm water, and turn out the blancmange on glass dishes.
      You may color almond or vanilla blancmange a fine pink, by putting into
      the cream chips of alkanet root tied in a small thin muslin bag, to be
      removed as soon as the cream is highly colored. Or, it may be made green
      by the infusion of spinach juice, obtained by pounding in a marble mortar,
      and then boiling and straining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gelatine is now frequently used for blancmange and jelly, instead of
      calves' feet or isinglass. It has no advantage but that of being more
      speedily prepared than calves' feet, which must be boiled the day before.
      Four cakes of gelatine are equal to four calves' feet. Before using, they
      must be soaked for an hour or more in a pan of cold water, then boiled
      with the other ingredients.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499"
      id="Page_499">[499]</a></span> Some persons think they perceive an
      unpleasant taste in gelatine; perhaps they have heard of what it is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      When calves' feet cannot be obtained, pigs' feet will do very well, if
      nobody knows it. Four feet of calves are equal to eight of pigs. They are
      very glutinous, and have no perceptible taste.

      Break up a half pound of the best double-refined loaf sugar. On some of

      FARINA.&mdash;

      Farina is a very fine and delicate preparation, made from the inner part
      of the grain of new wheat. It is exceedingly nutritious, and excellent
      either for invalids or for persons in health. It is now much in use, and
      is to be had, in packages of a pound or half a pound, of the best grocers
      and druggists, and is highly recommended by physicians for gruel and
      panade. It also makes an excellent pudding, either boiled or baked,
      prepared in the same manner as any flour pudding. For boiling farina,
      nothing is so good as a <i>bain-marie</i> or double kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>For Farina Blancmange.</i>&mdash;From a quart of rich milk take out a
      half pint. Put the half pint into a small sauce-pan, and add to it a
      handful of bitter almonds broken up; or a bunch of fresh peach leaves, or
      a vanilla bean split, cut up, and tied in a thin muslin bag. When this
      milk has boiled till very highly flavored, strain it into the pint and a
      half, and set it over the fire in a porcelain kettle or a <i>bain-marie</i>.
      When the milk has come to a boil, sprinkle in, gradually, a large half
      pint or more (or four large heaping table-spoonfuls) of farina, stirring
      it well&mdash;also sprinkling in and stirring, as if making thick mush.
      Let it boil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
      slowly a quarter of an hour after the farina is all in. When done, remove

      water, and beat it till very thick and smooth. Then beat the whites to a
      stiff froth, beginning slowly at first, but gradually beating faster. Then
      add the beaten yolk very gently to the whites. Have ready a silver or
      plated dish well-buttered. Use tin for want of better, but it will not
      look well, as the omelette has to be served up in the dish it was baked
      in. Place the dish with the mixture in a hot oven, and watch it while
      baking. When it has well risen, and seems very light, take it out of the
      oven for a moment; run a knife round it, sift some sugar over it, set it
      again in the oven, and when raised to its utmost take it out again, and

      tasting poorly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Creamed Pine-apple.</i>&mdash;Cut into four pieces two large ripe
      pine-apples. Stand them up successively in a deep dish, and grate them
      from the rind. When all is grated, transfer it to a large glass bowl, and
      make it very sweet by mixing in powdered white loaf sugar. Whip to a stiff
      froth a sufficiency of rich cream, adding to it some sugar, and heap it
      high upon the grated pine-apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peaches and Cream.</i>&mdash;Take fine juicy freestone peaches. Pare
      them, and cut them in slices. Put them, with their juice, into a large
      bowl, and make them very sweet with powdered loaf sugar. Set them on ice,
      and let them remain in the juice till wanted. Then send them to table with
      fresh sugar sifted over the top. Set near them pitchers of plain cream,
      not frothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot obtain cream, it is better to be satisfied with sugar alone,
      than to substitute milk, with peaches, or any other fruit.

      CHARLOTTE RUSSE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Split, cut up, and boil a large vanilla bean in half a pint of rich milk,
      till it is highly flavored, and reduced to one-half. Then strain out the
      vanilla through a strainer so fine as to avoid all the seeds. Mix the
      strained milk with half a pint of rich cream. Beat five eggs till very
      smooth and thick. Strain them, and add them gradually to the cream when it
      is entirely cold, to make a rich custard. Set this custard over the fire
      (stirring it all the time) till it simmers; but take it off before it
      comes to a boil, or it will curdle. Set it on ice. Have ready in another
      sauce-pan an ounce of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508"
      id="Page_508">[508]</a></span> Russia isinglass, boiled in half a pint of
      water, till it is all dissolved into a thick jelly. When both are cold,
      (but not hard) mix the custard and the isinglass together, and add four
      table-spoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar. Then take a large lump of loaf
      sugar, and rub off on it the yellow rind of two large lemons. Scrape off
      the lemon-grate with a tea-spoon, and add it to the mixture, with the lump
      of sugar powdered and crushed fine. Mix together the strained juice of the
      lemons, and two glasses of madeira; dissolve in them the lemon-flavored
      sugar, and mix it with a pint of rich cream that has been whipped with a
      whisk to a strong froth. Add the whipped cream gradually to the custard,
      starring very hard at the time, and also after the whole is mixed. Then
      set it on ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cover the bottom of a flat oval dish with a slice of almond sponge cake,
      cut to fit. Prepare a sufficient number of oblong slices of the cake, (all
      of the same size and shape) to go all round; with one extra slice, in case
      they should not quite hold out. Dip every one in a plate of beaten white
      of egg to make them adhere. Stand each of them up on one end, round the
      large oval slice that lies at the bottom. Make them follow each other
      evenly and neatly, (every one lapping a little way over its predecessor)
      till you have a handsome wall of slices, cemented all round by the white
      of egg. Fill it quite full with the custard mixture. Cover the top with
      another oval slice of cake, cemented with a little white of egg<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span> to the
      upper edge of the wall. Make a nice icing in the usual way, of powdered
      sugar beaten into frothed white of egg, and flavored with lemon, orange,
      or rose. Spread this icing thickly and smoothly over the cake that covers
      the top of the charlotte, and ornament it with a handsome pattern of sugar
      flowers. There is no charlotte russe superior to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Another Charlotte Russe.</i>&mdash;Have a very nice circular lady cake.
      It should be iced all over, and ornamented with sugar flowers. Take off
      the top nicely, and without breaking or defacing, and hollow out the
      inside, leaving the sides and bottom standing. The cake taken from the
      inside may be cut in regular pieces and used at tea, or for other
      purposes. Make a very fine boiled custard, according to the preceding
      receipt. Fill with it the empty cake, as if filling a mould. Then put on
      the lid, set the whole on ice, and when wanted serve it up on a glass or
      china dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      A charlotte that requires no cooking may be very easily made by hollowing
      a nice circular almond sponge cake, and filling it with layers of small
      preserves, and piling on the top whipped cream finely flavored.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the walls of a charlotte russe you may use the oblong sponge cakes,
      called Naples biscuits, or those denominated lady fingers, dipping them
      first in beaten white of egg, standing them on end, and arranging them so
      as to lap over each other in forming the wall. Arrange some of them

      ICE CREAM.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Pewter freezers for ice cream are better than those of block tin; as in
      them the freezing goes on more gradually and thoroughly, and it does not
      melt so soon, besides being smoother when done. The ice tub should be
      large enough to allow ample space all round (six inches, at least,) the
      freezer as it stands in the centre, and should have a plug at the bottom
      (beneath the freezer) for letting out the water that drips from the ice;
      that a large coarse woolen cloth should be folded, and laid under it and
      around it. The ice should be broken up into small bits, and mixed with
      coarse salt, in the proportion of a pound of salt to five pounds of ice.
      Fill the tub within three inches of the top; pounding and pressing down
      hard the mixed ice and salt. Have ready all the ingredients. To every
      quart of <i>real</i> rich cream mix in a pint of milk, (not more) and half
      a pound of fine loaf sugar. The following are the most usual flavorings,
      all the fruit being made very sweet. Ripe strawberries or raspberries,
      mashed through a sieve till all the juice is extracted; ripe juicy
      freestone peaches, pared, and cut in half, the kernels being taken from
      the stones, are pounded, and mashed with the fruit through a cullender;
      all the juice that can be mashed out of a sliced pine-apple, the grated
      yellow rind and the juice of lemons or oranges, allowing two to each quart
      of cream, and mixing the juice with plenty of sugar before it is put to
      the cream. A handful of shelled bitter almonds blanched, broken, and
      boiled by themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511"
      id="Page_511">[511]</a></span> half a pint of milk till all the almond
      flavor is extracted, and then strain the bitter almond milk into the
      cream. For vanilla flavor, split and cut up a vanilla bean, boil it by
      itself in a half pint of milk, and when highly flavored, strain the
      vanilla milk into the cream. For chocolate ice cream, scrape down a
      quarter of a pound of Baker's prepared cocoa, and melt it in just water
      enough to cover it; then sweeten and mix it gradually into a quart of rich
      milk, (boiling at the time) and then boil and stir it till strong and
      smooth. Ice cream is spoiled by the addition of eggs. Besides giving it a
      yellowish color, eggs convert it into mere frozen custard, particularly if
      instead of using real cream, it is made of milk thickened with arrow-root
      or flour. For company at least, ice cream should be made in the best and
      most liberal manner, or else do not attempt it. Mean ice cream is a very
      mean thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all the ingredients are prepared and mixed, put the whole into the
      freezer, and set it in the ice tub; and having put on the lid tightly,
      take the freezer by the handle and turn it about very fast for five or six
      minutes. Then remove the lid carefully, and scrape down the cream from the
      sides with a spaddle or long-handled spoon. Repeat this frequently while
      it is freezing, taking care to keep the sides clear, stirring it well to
      the bottom, and keeping the tub well filled with salt and ice outside the
      freezer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the cream has been well frozen in the freezer, transfer it to
      moulds, pressing it in hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512"
      id="Page_512">[512]</a></span> so as to fill every part of the mould. Then
      set the mould in a fresh tub of ice and salt, (using as before the
      proportion of a pound of salt to five pounds of ice) and let it remain
      undisturbed in the mould for an hour, not turning it out till it is time
      to serve it up to the company. Then wrap a cloth, dipped in warm water,
      round the outside of the moulds, open them, and turn out the frozen cream
      on glass or china dishes, and serve it up immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless ice cream is very highly flavored at the beginning, its taste will
      be much weakened in the process of freezing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most usual form of ice cream moulds are pyramids, dolphins, doves, and
      baskets of fruit. We have seen ice cream in the shape of a curly lap-dog,
      and very well represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you eat what is called strawberry ice cream looking of an exquisite
      rose-pink color, there is no strawberry about it, either in tint or taste.
      It is produced by alkanet or cochineal. Real strawberries do not color so
      beautifully; neither do raspberries, or any other sort of red fruit. But
      genuine fruit syrups may be employed for this purpose, having at least the
      true taste. To make strawberry or raspberry syrup, prepare first what is
      called simple syrup, by melting a pound of the best double-refined loaf
      sugar in half a pint of cold water; and when melted, boiling them
      together, and skimming it perfectly clean. Then stir in as much fruit
      juice (mashed and strained,)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513"
      id="Page_513">[513]</a></span> as will give it a fine tinge, and let it
      have one more boiling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Vanilla Syrup.</i>&mdash;Take six fine fresh vanilla beans. Split, and
      cut them in pieces. Scrape the seeds loose in the pods with your finger
      nail, and bruise and mash the shells. All this will increase the vanilla
      flavor. Put all you can get of the vanilla into a small quart of what is
      called by the druggist "absolute alcohol." Cork the bottle closely, and
      let the vanilla infuse in it a week. Then strain it through a very fine
      strainer that will not let out a single seed. Have ready half a dozen pint
      bottles of simple syrup. Put into every bottle of the simple syrup a
      portion of the strained infusion of vanilla. Cork it tightly and use it
      for vanilla flavoring in ice creams, custards, blancmange, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Orange or Lemon Syrups</i>&mdash;Are made by paring off the yellow rind
      very thin (after the fruit has been rolled under your hand on a table to
      increase the juice,) then boiling the rind till the water is highly
      flavored. Strain this water over the best loaf sugar, allowing two pounds
      of sugar to a pint of juice. The sugar being melted, mix it with the
      juice.

      WATER ICES OR SHERBET.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Water ices are made of the juice of fruits, very well sweetened, mixed
      with a little water, and frozen in the manner of ice cream, to which they
      are by many persons preferred. They are all prepared nearly<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span> in the
      same manner, allowing a pint of juice to a pint of water, and a quarter of
      a pound of sugar. Mix it well, and then freeze it in the manner of ice
      cream, and serve it up in glass bowls. For lemon and orange sherbet, first
      roll the fruit on a table under your hand; then take off a very thin
      paring of the yellow rind, and boil it slowly in a very little water, till
      all the flavor is extracted. Next, strain the flavored water into the cold
      water you intend to mix with the juice, and make it very sweet with loaf
      sugar. Squeeze the juice into it through a tin strainer to avoid the
      seeds. Stir the whole very hard, and transfer it to a freezer. Orange
      water-ice is considered the best, if well made. For pine-apple water-ice,
      pare, core, and slice fine <i>ripe</i> apples very thin. Put them into a
      dish with thick layers of powdered loaf sugar; cover the dish, and let
      them lie several hours in the sugar. Then press out all the juice you can,
      from the pine-apple; mix it with a little water, and freeze it. To two
      large pine-apples allow a half pound of sugar, which has been melted in a
      quart of boiling water. This looks very well frozen in a mould shaped like
      a pine-apple. <i>Orange</i> sherbet may be frozen in a pine-apple mould.
      It can be made so rich with orange juice as to perfume the whole table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Roman Punch</i>&mdash;Is made of strong lemonade or orangeade, adding
      to every quart a pint of brandy or rum. Then freeze it, and serve in
      saucers or a large glass bowl. Put it into a porcelain kettle, and boil
      and skim it till the scum ceases to rise.<span class="pagenum"><a

    <h3 class="subh">
      PLUM CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      In making very fine plum cake first prepare the fruit and spice, and sift
      the flour (which must be the very best superfine,) into a large flat dish,
      and dry it before the fire. Use none but the very best fresh butter; if of
      inferior quality, the butter will taste through every thing, and spoil the
      cake. In fact, all the ingredients should be excellent, and liberally
      allowed. Take the best bloom or muscatel raisins, seeded and cut in half.
      Pick and wash the currants or plums through two waters, and dry them well.
      Powder the spice, and let it infuse over night in the wine and brandy. Cut
      the citron into slips, mix it with the raisins and currants, and dredge
      all the fruit very thickly, on both sides, with flour. This will prevent
      its sinking or clodding in the cake, while baking. Eggs should always be
      beaten till the frothing is over, and till they become thick and smooth,
      as thick as a good boiled custard, and quite smooth on the surface. If you
      can obtain hickory-rods as egg-beaters, there is nothing so good; but if
      you cannot get <i>them</i>, use the common egg-beaters, of thin fine wire.
      For stirring butter and sugar you should have a spaddle, which resembles a
      short mush-stick flattened at one end. Stir the butter and sugar in a deep
      earthen pan, and continue till it is light, thick, and creamy. Beat eggs
      always in a broad shallow earthen pan, and with a short<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span> quick
      stroke, keeping your right elbow close to your side, and moving only your
      wrist. In this way you may beat for an hour without fatigue. But to stir
      butter and sugar is the hardest part of cake making. Have this done by a
      man servant. His strength will accomplish it in a short time&mdash;also,
      let him give the final stirring to the cake. If the ingredients are
      prepared as far as practicable on the preceding day, the cake may be in
      the oven by ten or eleven o'clock in the forenoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a large plum cake allow one pound, (or a quart) of sifted flour; one
      pound of fresh butter cut up in a pound of powdered loaf sugar, in a deep
      pan; twelve eggs; two pounds of bloom raisins; two pounds of Zante
      currants; half a pound of citron, either cut into slips or chopped small;
      a table-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon, mixed; two grated nutmegs;
      a large wine-glass of madeira (or more), a wine-glass of French brandy,
      mixed together, and the spice steeped in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      First stir the butter and sugar to a light cream, and add to them the
      spice and liquor. Then beat the eggs in a shallow pan till very thick and
      smooth, breaking them one at a time into a saucer to ascertain if there is
      a bad one among them. One stale egg will spoil the whole cake. When the
      eggs are very light, stir them gradually into the large pan of butter and
      sugar in turn with the flour, that being the mixing pan. Lastly, add the
      fruit and citron, a little at a time of each,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span> and give the whole a hard
      stirring. If the fruit is well floured it will not sink, but it will be
      seen evenly dispersed all over the cake when baked. Take a large
      straight-sided block tin pan, grease it inside with the same butter used
      for the cake, and put the mixture carefully into it. Set it immediately
      into a well-heated oven, and keep up a steady heat while it is baking.
      When nearly done, the cake will shrink a little from the sides of the pan;
      and on probing it to the bottom with a sprig from a corn broom, or a
      splinter-skewer, the probe will come out clean. Otherwise, keep the cake
      in the oven a little longer. If it cracks on the top, it is a proof of its
      being very light. When quite done, take it out. It will become hard if
      left to grow cold with the oven. Set it to cool on an inverted sieve.

      ICING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Allow to the white of each egg a quarter of a pound of the best loaf
      sugar, finely powdered; but if you find the mixture too thin, you must add
      still more sugar. Put the white of egg into a shallow pan, and beat it
      with small rods or a large silver fork, till it becomes a stiff froth, and
      stands alone without falling. Then beat in the powdered sugar, a
      tea-spoonful at a time. As you proceed, flavor it with lemon juice. This
      will render the icing whiter and smoother, also improving the taste. You
      may ice the cake as soon as it becomes lukewarm, without waiting till it
      is quite cold. Dredge it lightly with flour to<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span> absorb the grease from the
      outside; then wipe off the flour. With a broad knife put some icing on the
      middle of the cake, and then spread it down, thickly and evenly, all over
      the top and sides, smoothing it with another knife dipped in cold water.
      When this is quite dry, spread on a second coat of icing rather thinner
      than the first, and flavored with rose. Set it a few minutes in the oven
      to harden the icing, leaving the oven-door open; or place it beneath the
      stove. When the icing is quite dry, you may ornament it with sugar borders
      and flowers; having ready, for that purpose, some additional icing. By
      means of a syringe, (made for the purpose, and to be obtained at the best
      furnishing stores) you can decorate the surface of the cake very
      handsomely; but it requires taste, skill, and practice. You may first
      cover the cake with pink, brown, green, or other colored icing, and then
      take white icing to decorate it, forming the pattern by moving your hand
      skilfully and steadily over it, and pressing it out of the syringe as you
      go. An easier way is to ornament the cake (when the top-icing is nearly
      dry, but not quite,) with large strawberries or raspberries, or purple
      grapes placed very near each other, and arranged in circles or patterns.
      Be careful not to mash the berries.

      <i>Warm Icing.</i>&mdash;This is made in the usual proportion of the
      whites of four eggs, beaten to stiff froth, and a pound of finely powdered
      loaf sugar afterwards added to it, gradually. Then boil the egg and sugar
      in a porcelain kettle, and skim it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520"
      id="Page_520">[520]</a></span> till the scum ceases to rise. Take it off
      the fire, and stir into it sufficient orange juice, lemon juice, or
      rose-water, to flavor it highly. Flour your cake&mdash;wipe off the flour,
      put on the icing with a broad knife, and then smooth it with another knife
      dipped in cold water. For this icing the cake should be warm from the
      oven, and dried slowly and gradually afterwards. Warm icing is much liked.
      It is very light; rises thick and high in cooling, and has a fine gloss.
      Try it. The mixture called by the French a <i>meringue</i>, and used for
      macaroons, kisses, and other nice articles, is made in the same manner as
      icing for cakes, allowing a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar to
      every beaten white of egg.

      POUND CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      One of Mrs. Goodfellow's maxims was, "up-weight of flour, and down-weight
      of every thing else"&mdash;and she was right, as the excellence of her
      cakes sufficiently proved, during the thirty years that she taught her art
      in Philadelphia, with unexampled success. Therefore, allow for a pound
      cake a rather small pound of sifted flour; a large pound of the best fresh
      butter, a large pound of powdered loaf sugar, ten eggs, or eleven if they
      are small; a large glass of mixed wine and brandy; a glass of rose-water;
      a grated nutmeg, and a heaped tea-spoonful of mixed spice, powdered mace,
      and cinnamon. Put the sugar into a <i>deep</i> earthen pan, and cut up the
      butter among it. In cold weather place it near<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span> the fire a few minutes,
      till the butter softens. Next, stir it very hard with a spaddle till the
      mixture becomes very light. Next, stir in, gradually, the spice, liquor,
      &amp;c. Then beat the eggs in a shallow pan with rods or a whisk, till
      light, thick, and smooth. Add them gradually to the beaten batter and
      sugar, in turn with the flour; and give the whole a hard stirring at the
      last. Have the oven ready with a moderate heat. Transfer the mixture to a
      thick straight-sided tin pan well greased with the best fresh butter, and
      smooth the butter on the surface. Set it immediately into the oven, and
      bake it with a steady heat two hours and a half, or more. Probe it to the
      bottom with a twig from a corn broom. When it shrinks a little from the
      pan it is done. When taken out, set it to cool on an inverted sieve. When
      you ice it, flavor the icing with lemon or rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be eaten fresh, as it soon becomes very dry.

      Pound cake is not so much in use as formerly, particularly for weddings
      and large parties; lady cake and plum cake being now substituted. A pound
      cake may be much improved by the addition of a pound of citron, sliced,
      chopped well, dredged with flour to prevent its sinking, and stirred
      gradually into the batter, in turn with the sifted flour and beaten egg.<span

      SPONGE CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Many persons suppose that sponge cake must be very easy to make, because
      there is no butter in it. On the contrary, the want of butter renders it
      difficult to get light. A really good sponge cake is a very different
      thing from those numerous tough leathery compositions that go by that
      name, and being flavored with nothing, are not worthy of eating <i>as cake</i>,
      and are neither palatable nor wholesome as diet, unless too fresh to have
      grown dry and hard. The best sponge cake we know of is made as follows,
      and even that should be eaten the day it is baked. Sift half a pound of
      flour, (arrow-root is still better,) in a shallow pan; beat twelve eggs
      till very thick, light, and smooth. You need not separate the yolks and
      whites, if you know the true way of adding the flour. Beat a pound of
      powdered loaf sugar, gradually, (a little at a time) into the beaten eggs,
      and add the juice and grated yellow rinds of two large lemons or oranges.
      Lastly stir in the flour or arrow root. It is all important that this
      should be done slowly and lightly, and without stirring down to the bottom
      of the pan. Hold the egg-beater perpendicularly or quite upright in one
      hand, and move it round on the surface of the beaten egg, while with the
      other hand you lightly and gradually sprinkle in the flour till all is in.
      If stirred in hard and fast it will render the cake porous and tough, and
      dry and hard when cold. Have ready either a large turban mould, or some
      small oblong or square tins. Butter them nicely, transfer to them the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span> cake
      mixture, grate powdered sugar profusely over the surface to give it a
      gloss like a very thin crust, and set it immediately into a brisk oven.
      The small oblong cakes are called Naples biscuits, and require no icing. A
      large turban cake may be iced plain, without ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>very light</i> sponge cake, when sliced, will cut down rough and
      coarse grained, and it is desirable to have it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Fingers</i>&mdash;Are mixed in the same manner, and of the same
      ingredients as the foregoing receipt for the best sponge cake. When the
      mixture is finished, form the cakes by shaping the batter with a
      tea-spoon, upon sheets of soft white paper slightly damped, forming them
      like double ovals joined in the centre. Sift powdered sugar over them, and
      bake them in a quick oven till slightly browned. When cool, take them off
      the papers. They are sometimes iced.

      ALMOND SPONGE CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The addition of almonds makes this cake very superior to the usual sponge
      cake. Sift half a pound of fine flour or arrow root. Blanch in scalding
      water two ounces of shelled sweet almonds, and two ounces of bitter ones,
      renewing the hot water when expedient. When the skins are all off, wash
      the almonds in cold water, (mixing the sweet and bitter) and wipe them
      dry. Pound them to a fine smooth paste, (one at a time,) in a very clean
      marble mortar, adding, as you proceed, plenty of rose-water to prevent
      their oiling. Then set them in a cool place. Beat twelve<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span> eggs
      till very smooth and thick, and then beat into them, gradually, a pound of
      powdered loaf sugar, in turn with the pounded almonds. Lastly, add the
      flour, stirring it round slowly and lightly on the surface of the mixture,
      as in common sponge cake. Have ready a <i>deep</i> square pan. Butter it
      nicely. Put the mixture carefully into it, set it into the oven, and bake
      it till thoroughly done and risen very high. When cool, cover it with
      plain white icing, flavored with rose-water. With sweet almonds, always
      use a small portion of bitter ones. Without them, <i>sweet</i> almonds
      have little or no taste, though they add to the richness of the cake.

      SPANISH BUNS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      In a shallow pan put a half pint of rich unskimmed milk, and cut up in it
      a half pound of the best fresh butter. Set it on the stove, or near the
      fire, to warm and soften, but do not let it melt or oil. When soft, stir
      it all through the milk with a broad knife, and then set it away to cool.
      Sift into a broad pan half a pound of the finest flour, and an additional
      quarter of a pound put on a plate by itself. Beat four eggs in a shallow
      pan till very thick and smooth, and mix them at once into the butter and
      sugar, adding the half pound of flour. Stir in a powdered nutmeg, and two
      wine-glasses of strong yeast, fresh from the brewer's, first removing the
      thin liquid or beer from the top. Stir the mixture very hard with a knife,
      and then add,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
      <i>gradually</i>, half a pound of powdered white sugar. The buns will
      become heavy if the sugar is thrown in all at once. It is important that
      it should be added a little at a time. Then sprinkle in, by degrees, the
      extra quarter of a pound of sifted flour, and lastly add a wine-glass of
      strong rose-water. When all has been well stirred, butter (with fine fresh
      butter,) an oblong iron or block-tin pan, and carefully put the bun
      mixture into it. Cover it with a clean cloth, and set it near the fire to
      rise. It may require five hours; therefore buns wanted for tea should be
      made in the forenoon. When the batter has risen very high, and is covered
      with bubbles, put the pan immediately into a moderate but steady oven, and
      bake it. When cool, cut the buns into squares, and ice each one
      separately, if for company; the icing being flavored with lemon or orange
      juice. Otherwise, you may simply sift sugar over them. These buns were
      first introduced by Mrs. Goodfellow; and in her school were always
      excellently made, nothing being spared that was good, and the use of soda
      and other alkalis being unknown in the establishment&mdash;hartshorn in
      cakes would have horrified her.

      LADY CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This cake must be flavored highly with bitter almonds; without them, sweet
      almonds have little or no taste, and are useless in lady cake. Blanch, in
      scalding water, three small ounces of shelled bitter almonds, and then lay<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span> them in
      a bowl of very cold water. Afterwards wipe them dry, and pound them (one
      at a time,) to a smooth paste in a clean marble mortar; adding, as you
      proceed, a wine-glass of rose-water to improve the flavor, and prevent
      their oiling, and becoming heavy and dark. When done, set them away in a
      cool place, on a saucer. Almonds are always lighter and better when
      blanched and pounded the day before. Cut up three quarters of a pound of
      the best fresh butter in a pound of powdered loaf sugar. Mix it in a deep
      earthen pan, and stir and beat it with a spaddle till it becomes very
      light and creamy. Then, gradually, stir in the pounded almonds. Take the
      <i>whites only</i> of seventeen or eighteen fresh eggs, and beat them in a
      shallow pan to a stiff froth, till they stand alone. Then stir the beaten
      white of egg, gradually, into the pan of creamed butter and sugar, in turn
      with three small quarters of a pound (or a pint and a half,) of sifted
      flour of the very best quality. Stir the whole very hard at the last, and
      transfer it to a straight-sided tin pan, well greased with excellent fresh
      butter. Set the pan immediately into an oven, and bake it with a moderate
      but steady heat. When it has been baking rather more than two hours, probe
      it by sticking down to the bottom a twig from a corn broom, or a very
      narrow knife. If it comes out clean the cake is done; if clammy or daubed,
      keep it longer in the oven. A cake when quite done generally shrinks a
      little. When you take it out, set it to cool on an inverted sieve. Ice a<span

      flour your pasteboard well, place the loaf upon it, and having prepared in
      a pint bowl a stiff mixture of ground cinnamon, fresh butter, and brown
      sugar, beaten together so as to stand alone, make numerous deep cuts or
      incisions all over the surface on the sides and top of the cake; fill them

      GOLDEN CAKE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The best time for making this cake is when ripe oranges are plenty. For
      one cake select four large deep-colored oranges, and roll each one under
      your hand upon a table to soften them, and increase the juice. Weigh a
      pound of the best loaf sugar. On some of the largest pieces rub off the
      yellow or outer rind of the oranges, omitting the white entirely. The
      white or inner rind of oranges or lemons should never be used for any
      thing. Cut the oranges, and squeeze their juice through a strainer into a
      large saucer or a small deep plate. Powder all the sugar, including that
      which has the orange zest upon it, and put it into a deep earthen pan,
      with a pound of the best fresh butter cut up among it. With a wooden
      spaddle stir the butter and sugar together, till very light and creamy. In
      a shallow pan beat twelve eggs, omitting the <i>whites</i> of three. Sift
      into a dish a small quart of the best and finest flour, and stir it
      gradually into the pan of butter and sugar and orange, in turn with the
      beaten egg, a little at a time of each. Stir the whole very hard; and when
      done, immediately transfer the batter to square tin pans,<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span> greased
      with the same fresh butter that was used for the cake. Many a fine cake
      has been spoiled, at last, by the poor economy of greasing the pans with
      salt butter. Fill the pans to the top. If the cake has been well made, and
      well beaten, there is no danger of the batter running over the edges. Put
      it, immediately, into a quick oven and bake it well, not allowing the heat
      to be lessened till the cake is quite done. When cool, cut it into
      squares. If you ice it, flavor the icing with orange juice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not attempt to make this cake with yolk of egg only, by way of
      improving the yellow color. Without any whites, it will assuredly be tough
      and heavy. Cakes may be made light with white of egg only, but never with
      yellow of egg only.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use soda, saleratus, hartshorn, or any of the alkalis, they will
      entirely destroy the orange flavor, and communicate a bad taste of their
      own.

      plate. When all are done, put them into a very cool place. In a deep
      earthen pan cut up a pound of fresh butter into a pound of powdered sugar,
      and with a wooden spaddle stir the butter and sugar together till
      perfectly light. Into another pan sift three quarters of a pound of fine
      flour, and in a broad shallow pan beat with small rods the whites only of
      eighteen eggs till they are stiff enough to stand alone. Then, gradually,
      and alternately, stir into the pan of beaten butter and sugar the flour,
      the beaten white of eggs, and the pounded almonds. Give the whole a hard
      stirring at the last. Transfer it to square tin pans greased with the same
      butter, and bake it well. When cool, cut it into square cakes, and send it
      to table on china plates, piled alternately with pieces of golden cake,
      handsomely arranged. If you ice silver cake, flavor the icing with strong
      rose-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      These cakes, (gold or silver) if made as above, will be found delicious.
      The yolk of egg left from the silver cake may be used for soft custards.
      But yolk of egg alone, will not raise a cake; though white of egg will.

      while longer before you bake the whole. Pile portions of the meringue on
      sheets of letter paper, placing each heap far apart. Smooth and shape them

      Cut up in a deep pan half a pound of the best fresh butter, with a half
      pound of excellent brown sugar; and stir it to cream with a spaddle. Add a

      table-spoonfuls of ginger; a heaped table-spoonful of mixed powdered
      cinnamon and powdered mace and nutmeg; and a glass of brandy. Sift in a
      pound and a half of fine flour. Beat six eggs till very light and thick,
      and mix them, alternately, into the pan of butter, sugar, molasses, &amp;c.
      At the last, mix in the yellow rind (grated fine) of two large oranges and
      the juice. Stir the whole very hard. Melt in one cup a very small level
      tea-spoonful of soda, and in another a small level salt-spoon of tartaric
      acid. Dissolve them both in lukewarm water, and see that both are quite
      melted. First stir the soda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539"
      id="Page_539">[539]</a></span> into the mixture, and then put in the
      tartaric acid. On no account exceed the quantity of the two alkalis, as if
      too much is used, they will destroy entirely the flavoring, and
      communicate a very disagreeable taste instead. Few cakes are the better
      for any of the alkaline powders, and many sorts are entirely spoiled by
      them. Even in gingerbread they should be used very sparingly, rather less
      than more of the prescribed quantity. Having buttered, (with the same
      butter) a large round or oblong pan, put in the mixture, and bake it in a
      moderate oven till thoroughly done, keeping up a steady heat, but watching
      that it does not burn. There is no gingerbread superior to this, if well

      PIGEON PIE.&mdash;

      For this pie take six fine fat tame pigeons, carefully cleaned and picked.
      Lay them in cold water for an hour, changing the water twice during that
      time. This is to remove what is called "the taste of the nest." Have ready
      the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs, seasoned with powdered nutmeg. Place a
      bit of fresh butter rolled in flour, in the inside of each pigeon, with
      its liver cut up, and with a yolk of egg seasoned with powdered mace. Lay
      a nice tender beef steak, or thin veal cutlet, in the bottom of a large
      deep dish, that has been lined with puff-paste. Butter the steak, and
      dredge it with flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>.
      There must be meat enough to cover well the bottom of the pie dish. Lay
      the pigeons upon it, with the breast downward, (their heads and feet cut
      off, and their livers cut up, and put inside with the stuffing.) Fill up
      the dish with water. Roll out and put on the lid of the pie, which you may
      ornament with paste leaves or flowers, according to your taste. For
      company, pigeon pies are expected to look handsome. It is no longer
      fashionable to have the feet of the pigeons sticking out of the slit in
      the top of the paste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moorfowl, pheasants, partridges, or quails, may be made into pies in the

      the liquid; and while hot, stir into it a beaten egg and a bit of fresh

      roll it out rather thick; divide it in two circular sheets. Line with one
      sheet the bottom and sides of a deep pie dish, and put in the best pieces
      of chicken. Lay among them four hard-boiled eggs, sliced or quartered.
      Season well with powdered mace or nutmeg. The gravy being strained, pour
      that into the pie, and finish at the top with a layer of butter divided
      into small pieces, and dredge with flour. This is what the old English
      cookery books mean when they say&mdash;"Close the pie with a <i>lear</i>."

    <p>
      A chicken pie will be improved by the addition of a dozen or more large
      fresh oysters, stewed. If you add oysters, take off the lid or upper crust
      as soon as the pie is baked, and put in the oysters <i>then</i>; if put in
      at the beginning, they will bake too long. Replace the lid nicely, and
      send the pie to table hot.

      The lid should have in the top a cross slit with a nice paste flower in
      it. To make a paste flower roll out a straight narrow slip of paste, about
      four or five inches wide. Roll it up with your fingers as if you were

    <h2>
      <a name="SWEETMEATS" id="SWEETMEATS"></a>SWEETMEATS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No sweetmeats can either look well or taste well unless the fruit and the
      sugar are of the best quality. As in all other branches of cookery, it is
      false economy to provide bad or low-priced ingredients. It has of late
      years been difficult to obtain <i>very</i> good sugar at any price, so
      much is adulterated with flour or ground starch. In the common powdered
      sugar the flour is so palpable that we are surprised at its having any
      sale at all; and the large quantity required to produce any perceptible
      sweetness renders it totally unfit for sweetmeats, or indeed for any thing
      else. The best brown sugar is better than this, having clarified it with
      white of egg. To do this, allow to every pound of sugar the beaten white
      of an egg, and a half pint of clear cold water. Having poured the water on
      the sugar, let it stand to melt before it goes on the fire. Then add the
      white of egg and put in on to boil. When it boils, carefully take off the
      scum as it rises, and add when it is boiling hard another jill or quarter
      pint of water for each pound of sugar. Remove it from the fire when the
      scum ceases to rise, and let it stand for a quarter of an hour to settle.
      Strain, and bottle it for use. The best brown sugar <i>thus prepared</i>
      will make a good syrup; and good marmalade, when white sugar of the best
      quality is not to be obtained. But for the nicest sweetmeats use always,
      if you can, the best double-refined loaf.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In warm weather there is nothing better for a preserving fire than a
      portable charcoal furnace placed out in the open air; as in a room with
      the doors or windows shut the vapor of charcoal is deadly, and never fails
      to produce suffocation. Of whatever the fire is made, it should be clear
      and steady without smoke or blaze. Never use copper or bell-metal for
      either preserving or pickling. For all such purposes employ only iron,
      lined with what is called porcelain or enamel, but is in reality a thick
      strong white earthen, first made at Delft, in Holland. This lining will
      crack if the kettle is placed over a blaze, which it should never be. All
      sweetmeats should be boiled with the lid off. If covered, the steam having
      no means of escaping, returns upon them, and causes them to look dark and
      unsightly. When done, put the sweetmeats warm into jars or glasses, and
      leave them open a few hours that the watery particles may evaporate, but
      have them all pasted and closely covered before night. Do nothing to
      render your preserves hard, or firm, as it is called. It is better to have
      them soft and tender. The old custom of steeping them for days in salt and
      water, and then boiling them in something else to remove the salt, is now
      considered foolish, and is seldom practised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put up jellies and small sweetmeats in common tumblers, laying on the
      surface of each a double cover of white tissue paper cut exactly to fit,
      and then put on another cover of thick white paper pleated and notched
      where it descends below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545"
      id="Page_545">[545]</a></span> edge, using always gum tragacanth paste,
      which you should keep always in the house, as it requires no boiling; and
      if in making it, a bit of corrosive sublimate (not larger than a
      cherry-stone) is dissolved with the ounce of gum tragacanth and the half
      pint of warm water, in a yellow or white-ware mug, and <i>stirred only
      with a stick</i>, the paste will never spoil, and if kept covered, will be
      found superior to all others. No metal must touch this cement, as it will
      then turn black and spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep your sweetmeats always in a dry place. But if after a while you see a
      coat of mould on the surface, you need not throw them away, till you have
      tried to recover them by carefully removing every particle of mould,
      filling up the jars with fresh sugar, and setting them, one by one, in a
      bottle of water, and in this way boiling them over again. But if they have
      an unpleasant smell, and you see insects about them, of course they must
      be thrown away. To purify jars, clean and scrape them, and wash them
      thoroughly with ley and water, or with a solution of soda&mdash;afterwards
      exposing them to the sun and air for a week or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jellies.</i>&mdash;We have already given directions for various fruit
      jellies in the chapter on Fine Desserts. They are all made nearly in the
      same manner, using the juice of the fruit, and sufficient sugar to make it
      congeal and to keep it. Jellies should always be bright and transparent,
      and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
      therefore require the best and ripest of fruit and the finest of loaf
      sugar.

      MARMALADE OR JAMS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Marmalade or jams are the easiest sweetmeats to make, and are useful for
      all sweetmeat purposes. They are all made nearly in the same manner; and
      to be very good, and to keep well, at least a pound of fine sugar should
      be allowed to every pound of fruit&mdash;the fruit being quite ripe,
      freshly gathered, and of the best kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>For Peach Marmalade</i>&mdash;Take fine, juicy free-stone peaches. Pare
      them; cut them in half; remove the stones, and let them be saved and the
      kernels extracted to use as bitter almonds. Cut up the peaches, and allow
      for each pound a pound of sugar. Lay the peaches (with all the sugar among
      them,) in a large pan or tureen, and let them rest for three or four
      hours. Boil the peaches and sugar together in a porcelain kettle (without
      a cover) for half an hour, skimming and stirring well. When it becomes a
      thick smooth mass it is finished. Put it up in glass jars, and leave it
      uncovered till cool; but not longer. The flavor will be much improved by
      boiling with the peaches and sugar one or two handfuls of the kernels,
      blanched and pounded; or else a bunch of fresh peach leaves, to be removed
      afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Quince Marmalade</i> is made in the same manner&mdash;first carefully
      removing all the blemishes. Allow a pound of sugar to a pound of quinces.<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span> They
      must boil longer than peaches. All marmalades must be cooked till the form
      of the fruit is quite indistinguishable, and till it mashes into a thick
      smooth mass. Quinces should be allowed to remain on the trees till after
      the first frost, which greatly improves them. Persimmons and wild grapes
      are not eatable till they are touched by the frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tomato Marmalade.</i>&mdash;Make this when lemons are ripe and plenty.
      To every two pounds of tomatos allow two pounds of sugar, and the grated
      yellow rind and the juice of one lemon. The worst way of using lemons for
      any purpose is to merely slice them. Depend on the slices for flavoring,
      and they are wasted; the taste being scarcely perceptible. They should
      always be first rolled under your hand, which increases the yield of
      juice. Then grate off from the outside the <i>yellow</i> rind only (the
      white part of the rind is worse than useless,) and having cut the lemon,
      squeeze the juice through a tin strainer to exclude the seeds, which
      otherwise would be troublesome to pick out. The yellow rind and the juice
      are all you need want of a lemon for any purpose of flavoring. Scald the
      tomatos to make them peel easily, and mix the sugar thoroughly with them.
      Boil them slowly for an hour in a porcelain kettle, skimming carefully,
      and stirring well after each skimming. Then add the lemon grate and the
      juice, and boil the marmalade another half hour, or till it is a thick
      smooth mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pumpkin Marmalade.</i>&mdash;Take a fine ripe high-<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>colored pumpkin. Cut it up.
      Empty it very clean of the seeds and strings; take off a thick paring.
      Slice the pieces small and thin, and weigh them. To each pound of pumpkin
      allow a pound of powdered sugar, and the grated peel and the juice of one
      large lemon. Pumpkin sweetmeats require a high lemon flavoring. Boil the
      pumpkin alone, till quite soft. Then mash it in a cullender till the water
      is pressed out, and the pumpkin left dry. Afterwards put it into a
      porcelain kettle, mix with it the sugar and lemon, and boil it again till
      it becomes a thick jam. Cantaloupe marmalade is made in the same way with
      lemon and sugar&mdash;also marmalade of ripe figs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Plum Marmalade.</i>&mdash;Choose plums that are fully ripe. Allow to
      each pound a pound and a half of sugar. Scald them till the skins peel off
      easily, and extract all the stones. Lay them in the sugar for two or three
      hours or more, and then boil them till they become a thick smooth mass.
      Green-gages the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Raspberry Jam.</i>&mdash;To every quart of fine ripe raspberries allow
      a pound of best loaf sugar, powdered. Put them together into a broad
      white-ware pan, and let them rest for two or three hours. Then boil them
      in an uncovered porcelain kettle, taking off the scum carefully. When no
      more scum rises, mash them, and boil them to a smooth thick marmalade.
      When cold, put it up in half pint tumblers, and cover them with rounds of
      double tissue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
      paper, cut exactly to fit, and then with thick white paper dipped in
      brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Strawberry Jam.</i>&mdash;The strawberries must be quite ripe, and very
      fine. Allow to each quart a pound of powdered loaf sugar. Put them into a
      large white-ware pan; a layer of sugar and a layer of strawberries
      alternately, finishing with strawberries on the top. Let them rest in the
      sugar and juice three or four hours. Then boil and skim them till they
      become very thick and smooth. When cold, put them up in tumblers, with
      double tissue paper over the top. Blackberry jam is made in the same
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gooseberry Jam.</i>&mdash;Top and tail the gooseberries, which must be
      thoroughly ripe, and with thin skins. They require to every pound of fruit
      a pound and a half of sugar of the best sort. Mash them with a wooden
      beetle, and put them with all the sugar into an uncovered porcelain
      kettle, and boil and skim them. When half done add more sugar, and
      continue boiling till they are a very thick marmalade. When cold, cover
      the tumblers with brandy paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pine-apple Marmalade.</i>&mdash;Take the best and ripest pine-apples;
      remove the leaves, and split each pine-apple into four pieces, and cut out
      the core from the centre. Stand the pieces upright in a deep dish, and,
      with a large coarse grater grate down all the <i>flesh</i> of the fruit,
      as it is called. To every pint of grated pine-apple allow a pound of
      powdered loaf sugar, and put them together in a large tureen. Let them
      rest two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
      hours. Then transfer the whole to a porcelain kettle. Leave it uncovered;
      and boil, skim, and stir, till it becomes a very thick marmalade. When
      cool, put it up in glass jars. It is a very nice sweetmeat, particularly
      for shells or tarts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Grape Marmalade.</i>&mdash;Take a sufficiency of fine grapes,
      thoroughly ripe. Having picked them from the stems, mash them with a
      wooden beetle, and then press them through a sieve. To every pint of the
      pulp allow a pound of powdered sugar, well mixed in; let it stand an hour
      or two. Then boil it, uncovered, in a porcelain kettle, skimming and
      stirring well, till it is very thick and smooth. When cool, put it up in
      small marmalade pots of white-ware with lids, and paste a band of thick
      white paper round each, at the small crack where the cover fits on. A good
      marmalade for the backwoods may be made of wild grapes and maple sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cherry Marmalade.</i>&mdash;If you cannot procure morellas, (the best
      of all cherries for sweetmeats) use the large Virginia or carnation
      cherries. Black cherries are unfit for cooking. Stem and stone your
      cherries, saving all the juice you can. Allow a pound of powdered loaf
      sugar to every pint of cherries. Boil the fruit and the sugar together,
      uncovered, for an hour, skimming and stirring. When cool, put it in
      white-ware marmalade pots and paste the lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Orange Marmalade.</i>&mdash;Quarter some large ripe oranges, and remove
      the rind, the seeds, and the strings or filaments, taking care to save all<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span> the
      juice. Put the pulp, with the juice, into a porcelain kettle, and mix with
      it an equal quantity of strained honey, adding sufficient powdered loaf
      sugar to render it very thick and sweet. The honey alone will not make it
      sweet enough. Boil it uncovered, and skim it till very thick, smooth, and
      clear. Taste it, and if necessary add more sugar, and boil it longer. When
      cold, put it up in tumblers or white-ware marmalade pots, and cover it
      securely. This marmalade is exquisite, and very superior to any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Orange Milk.</i>&mdash;Take four dozen large ripe juicy oranges, and
      roll them under your hand. Cut them in two; remove the seeds, and squeeze
      the juice into a large clean stone jar. Have ready four pounds of the best
      double-refined loaf sugar, dissolved in a gallon of French brandy. Pour it
      into the jar that contains the orange juice; stir the mixture well, and
      add the yellow rind of the oranges, pared so thin from the white as to be
      transparent, and divide it into bits. Cover the jar, and let it stand four
      days, stirring it frequently. Then take a gallon of new unskimmed milk,
      (the morning's milk of that day,) boil it alone, and when it comes to a
      hard boil pour it into the mixture of orange, sugar, and brandy. Cover it
      closely, and let it stand till quite cold. Then strain it into another
      vessel through a linen jelly bag. Bottle it immediately, and seal the
      corks. It improves by keeping. To use it, pour it out in half tumblers,
      and fill up with ice water, or serve it round undiluted in small cordial<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span> glasses,
      after ice-cream. It is much admired, and in orange countries may be made
      in large quantities. Lemon milk is made in the same manner, having a
      larger proportion of sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fruit in Syrups.</i>&mdash;Make a syrup in the proportion of half a
      pint of water to every pound of sugar, and a pint of the juice of any sort
      of fine ripe fruit. Boil and skim it till very clear, but not till it
      congeals or jellies. Then bottle it, and cork the bottles. As the fresh
      fruit comes again into season, select the finest, largest, and ripest. For
      instance, half fill a white-ware preserve jar with fine fresh
      strawberries, and fill up from a bottle of strawberry syrup; or ripe
      raspberries with raspberry syrup; currants, with currant syrup, &amp;c.
      Cover them closely till wanted for immediate use.

      PRESERVED CITRON MELONS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take some fine citron melons; pare, core, and cut them into slices. Then
      weigh them; and, to every six pounds of melon, allow six pounds of the
      best double refined loaf sugar, and the juice and yellow rind (grated very
      fine,) of four large fresh lemons, and <i>a quarter</i> of a pound of root
      ginger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put the slices of lemon into a preserving kettle, and boil them half an
      hour or more, till they look <i>quite</i> clear, and are so tender that a
      broom twig will pierce through them. Then drain them; lay them in a broad
      pan of cold water, cover them, and let them stand all night. In the
      morning tie the root ginger in a thin muslin cloth, and boil<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span> it in
      three pints of clear spring or pump water till the water is highly
      flavored. Then take out the bag of ginger. Having broken up the sugar put
      it into a clean preserving kettle, and pour the ginger water over it. When
      the sugar is all melted set it over the fire, put in the grated yellow
      peel of the lemons, and boil and skim it till no more scum rises. Then put
      in the sliced citrons, and the juice of the lemons; and boil them in the
      syrup till all the slices are quite transparent, and so soft that a straw
      will go through them; but do not allow them to break. When quite done, put
      the slices (while still warm,) into wide-mouthed glass or white-ware jars,
      and gently pour on the syrup. Lay inside of each jar, upon the top of the
      syrup, a round of white paper dipped in brandy. Put on the lids of the
      jars, and tie leather over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be found a delicious sweetmeat; equal to any imported from the
      West Indies, and far less expensive.

      PINE-APPLES PRESERVED.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take six fine large pine-apples, as ripe as you can get them. Make them
      very clean, but do not, at first, pare off the rind or cut off the leaves.
      The rind and leaves being left on while boiling will <i>keep in</i> the
      flavor of the fruit. Put the pine-apples whole into a very large and very
      clean iron pot. Fill it up with cold water, and boil the pine-apples till
      they are so tender that you can pierce them through the rind to the core,
      with a splinter skewer or a twig from a corn broom. Then take them out of
      the pot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
      and drain them. When they are so cool as to be handled without
      inconvenience, remove the leaves, and pare off the rind. Cut then into
      round slices about half an inch thick, extracting the core from the centre
      as to leave a small round hole in every slice. Weigh them, and to each
      pound of fruit allow a pound of double refined loaf sugar, broken up and
      powdered. Cover the bottom of a large dish or dishes with a thick layer of
      the sugar. On this place a layer of pine-apple slices; then a layer of
      sugar; then a layer of fruit, and so on till the slices are all thickly
      covered, finishing with a layer of sugar at the top. Let them stand
      twenty-four hours. Then drain the slices from the syrup, and lay them in
      wide jars. Put all the syrup into a clear porcelain kettle, and boil and
      skim it till the scum ceases to rise. Then pour it hot upon the
      pine-apple. While warm, cover the jars closely with white paper cut to
      fit, and dipped in brandy; and then tie on a piece of bladder. There is no
      better way of preserving pine-apples, or that retains the flavor so well.

      PRESERVED LEMONS OR ORANGES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The fruit must be perfectly ripe, of the best quality, with a smooth rind
      and fine color. Cut out from the stem end of each, a piece not quite the
      size of a quarter dollar, and with a small knife scoop out all the inside,
      keeping the rind as whole as possible. Put the pulp and juice into a large<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span> bowl,
      and clear it from the strings and seeds. Lay the skins in a tureen of cold
      ice water, and change it twice during the day, (fresh water and fresh
      ice); and at bedtime put ice only. Next morning boil the skins slowly in a
      porcelain kettle with plenty of water, keeping them well covered. Continue
      to boil till they are tender all through, and can easily be pierced with a
      splinter skewer. Then drain them, and lay them in cold water immediately.
      Take care to boil with them the small round pieces that come out of the
      top. Make a thick jelly or marmalade of the pulp and juice of these, and
      some additional fruit, allowing to a pint of juice a pound of loaf sugar.
      When the jelly has been boiled till clear and firm when held in the air,
      fill with it the skins so as to swell them out into a good shape. Replace
      the small circular pieces that have been cut off the top of the fruit, and
      tie them on securely with packthread, so as to keep in the jelly. Next
      make a thin syrup, allowing to a pound of broken-up loaf sugar half a pint
      of fresh juice, and the beaten white of an egg. Boil and skim it till no
      more scum rises. Then having put the oranges into large glass jars rather

      proceed as directed in the last receipt. The skins, as soon as empty,
      being laid in cold water, and then filled and shaped out with lemon jelly,
      and the jars filled up warm with lemon syrup. Or by putting a larger
      portion of sugar, and boiling the syrup longer, you may candy it all over

      PEACHES PRESERVED.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take the finest ripe free-stone peaches. Pare them, cut them in half, and
      remove the stones. To every pound of peaches allow a pound of double
      refined loaf sugar, and half the white of an egg (slightly beaten) with
      half a pint of very clear soft water. Put the sugar into a porcelain
      preserving kettle, mix it with the water and white of egg, and when it has
      entirely dissolved, set it over the fire, and boil and skim it till the
      scum ceases to rise, which will be very soon, if the sugar is as good as
      it should be. There is no economy in using inferior sugar for sweetmeats,
      as much of it will be lost in skimming and sediment. In the mean time,
      boil in a little sauce-pan a bunch of fresh green peach leaves that have
      been cleared from all dust; or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557"
      id="Page_557">[557]</a></span> handful of broken-up peach kernels. When
      the flavor is well extracted, strain this water and mix it with the syrup.
      Then put in the halved peaches, and boil them (uncovered) till quite clear
      and soft, but not till they break. While warm, put them up with the syrup

      <i>Preserved Green Gages.</i>&mdash;Get the largest and ripest green
      gages, or egg plums. Scald them in boiling water to make them peel easily;
      the skins of all sorts of plums becoming very hard and tough when
      preserved. Remove the stems; they are no ornament, and render them
      troublesome to eat. Make a syrup in the usual way, allowing to each pound
      of plums a pound of the finest loaf sugar, half a pint of water, and half
      a white of egg. When well skimmed and boiled put in the plums, and boil
      them gently till quite clear and soft, but not till broken. All plums may
      be done in this manner. If not as ripe as possible, they will require to
      each pound of fruit a pound and a half of the best sugar.

      Take large juicy <i>free-stone</i> peaches, not so ripe as to burst or

      pint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
      water mixed with half a white of egg, slightly beaten. Put the sugar into
      a porcelain kettle, and pour the water upon it. When it is quite melted
      give it a stirring, set it over the fire, and boil and skim it till no
      more scum rises. Next put in the peaches, and let them cook (uncovered) in
      the syrup till they look clear, or for about half an hour, or till a straw
      will penetrate them. Then take the kettle off the fire. Having allotted a
      pint of the very best white brandy to each pound of peaches, mix it with
      the syrup, after taking out the fruit with a wooden spoon, and draining it
      over the kettle. Put the peaches into a large tureen. Let the syrup remain
      in the kettle a little longer. Mix the brandy with it, and boil them
      together ten minutes, or more. Transfer the peaches to large glass jars,
      (two thirds full,) and pour the brandy and syrup over them, filling quite
      up to the top. When cool, cover them closely, and tie some bladder over
      the lids.

      PRESERVED TOMATOS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      This is an excellent and popular sweetmeat, when flavored well with lemon,
      which is indispensable to making it palatable. Also, it should be well
      penetrated with sugar, therefore it is best not to attempt preserving
      tomatos whole. The best time for doing them<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span> is in the height of the
      lemon season. The most convenient for preserving are those with smooth
      even surfaces. If fluted or cleft they are difficult to peel when scalded,
      as the skins do not strip off so easily. Having weighed the tomatos,
      (which must be full-grown and quite ripe) allow to every two pounds, two
      pounds of the best <i>brown</i> sugar, a large spoonful of ground ginger,
      and the juice and grated yellow rind of one large ripe lemon, rolled
      awhile under your hand. Having scalded and peeled all the tomatos, and
      mixed with the sugar a little beaten white of egg, put them into a
      porcelain-lined preserving kettle, (uncovered,) and add, gradually, the
      sugar. Boil the tomatos and sugar <i>slowly</i> together, till the scum
      ceases to appear. Then add, gradually, the lemons, (peel and juice,) and
      boil slowly for an hour or more. The tomatos must all have bursted,
      otherwise they will not keep, from the sugar not getting sufficiently into
      them. When done, take them off the fire, and transfer to glass jars the
      tomatos with their syrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      For yellow preserves take yellow tomatos, scald and peel them, and prick
      each with a silver fork. Lay them in a porcelain preserving kettle with
      plenty of fresh vine leaves under and over them. Boil them with the vine
      leaves till they become a finer yellow. Then wash out the kettle and boil
      the tomatos, as above, with the <i>white</i> sugar, and add the lemon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Green Tomatos Preserved.</i>&mdash;Take green tomatos when they are
      full grown, but have not yet begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560"
      id="Page_560">[560]</a></span> to turn in the least red. Scald and peel
      them, and lay them in a porcelain kettle with plenty of fresh vine leaves
      at the bottom. Cover them thickly with another layer of vine leaves at the
      top. Boil them very slowly with the vine leaves till they have all turned
      yellow. Then take them out, and spread them on large dishes. Wash the
      kettle, put in fresh vine leaves under and over the tomatos. They should
      become a fine green with the second boiling in vine leaves; otherwise
      repeat the greening. Then take them out, wash the kettle again, and return
      the tomatos to it with <i>a pound and a half of white sugar</i> to each
      pound of tomatos. Boil and skim, till all is clear and nice. Then add the
      grated yellow rind and the juice of one large lemon to every pound of
      tomatos, and boil slowly an hour longer. All the tomatos should burst,
      that the sugar may thoroughly enter the inside. Before you cover the jars,
      stir into each an additional quarter or half pound of powdered sugar.
      Green tomatos require a high flavoring of lemon, as they have no peculiar
      taste of their own.

      PRESERVED QUINCES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take the largest and ripest yellow quinces; after they have remained on
      the trees till the first frost. Wipe them clean, and boil them whole till
      they are tender all through, and can be easily penetrated with a splinter
      skewer. Save and strain the water in which they were boiled. When cool,
      pare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
      core the quinces, and carefully remove the blemishes. To every pound of
      fruit allow a pound of the best double-refined loaf sugar. Make a syrup of
      the water in which the quinces were boiled, allowing half a pint of this
      water to every pound of sugar. When melted, set it in a porcelain kettle
      over a moderate fire, and boil and skim it till no more scum appears. Then
      put in the fruit, either whole or quartered, or cut into circular slices
      about half an inch thick; and boil it uncovered. When the quinces are
      quite clear and soft, (but not the least broken) take them out, and spread
      them on large flat dishes. Afterwards transfer them to large glass jars,
      rather more than half filled; pour the syrup warm over them; and when cool
      cover the jars, and tie pieces of bladder over the covers. You may boil,
      by themselves, the cores and parings, in as much water as will cover them
      well, till they are entirely dissolved. Then strain them through a linen
      bag, and while hot stir in as much powdered loaf sugar as will form a
      thick jelly. If the quinces have been preserved whole, fill up with this
      jelly the holes left by the cores; or if sliced, spread the jelly over the
      slices. Quinces soon become very hard and tough, unless they have been
      well boiled by themselves, before putting them into the sugar. Merely
      scalding or coddling them is not sufficient. If you have not jelly for
      filling up the holes, substitute marmalade. To keep quinces well, requires
      plenty of rich syrup.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>

      crab-apple with a dry clean flannel, and then prick every one in several
      places with a large needle to prevent their bursting. To every pound of
      fruit allow a pound and a half of double-refined loaf sugar, and a pint of
      water. First make a syrup of the sugar and water, boiling it in a
      porcelain kettle, and skimming it till perfectly clear. Put in the
      crab-apples, adding for each pound the juice and grated yellow rind of a
      large lemon. The lemon is indispensable to this sweetmeat. Simmer them
      slowly in this syrup till tender all through, so that they can be pierced
      with a twig of broom-corn; but do not allow them to break. When done, put
      them up warm in glass jars more than half full, and the syrup over them.
      You may heighten the fine red color with a little prepared cochineal&mdash;that

      seal them closely before you take them out of the water. Use the cement of
      two-thirds resin and one-third beeswax. Keep the jar for four weeks in a
      dry cool place. By that time you will find the strawberries with a thick
      white scum at the top, and a clear juice at the bottom. Pour it into clean
      bottles, through a funnel with a fine straining cloth. Cork the bottles,
      but do not drive the corks hard down, lest the bottles should burst if too

      a porcelain kettle with barely water enough to keep them from burning.
      When they are soft and broken, mash the pulp through a sieve, or squeeze

      large flat dish. Continue to boil the syrup a while longer, till you find
      it congeals well on holding out a spoonful in the open air. Then put the

    <h2>
      <a name="PICKLES" id="PICKLES"></a>PICKLES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For pickles the articles should all be fine and freshly gathered. They are
      generally too hard to be cut or eaten conveniently, and there is too much
      unnecessary fear of pickles proving soft. It is not now customary to keep
      them for weeks in salt and water; two or three days will be sufficient for
      this part of the process, and some kinds do not require it at all. The
      arts of both preserving and pickling are of late years much simplified.
      All pickles have nearly the same taste, and there is no use (and much
      trouble) in multiplying varieties, when a few sorts of the very best will
      be found amply sufficient for any table. One important point to be always
      observed, is to use none but the most wholesome vinegar, (the genuine
      cider,) as all that is made of drugs is unwholesome to the eater and
      destructive to the pickles. On no consideration boil them in brass,
      copper, or bell-metal&mdash;things which fortunately are now nearly
      exploded from all kitchens; iron lined with Delft, (called porcelain,)
      being universally substituted.
    </p>
    <p>
      To green pickles boil them with a thick bed of fresh vine leaves, both
      under and over them. This will first render them yellow; then boil them
      again in a clean kettle with fresh vine leaves. If not green enough when
      you think they are done, repeat the boiling again, with fresh vine<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span> leaves
      and fresh water. Avoid eating pickles that are of a fine verdigris green.
      They are greened with copper, and are poisonous.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot obtain vine leaves, you may green pickles by boiling them
      with fresh cabbage leaves under and over. The first boiling will turn them
      yellow, the second with new leaves should render them green. But vine
      leaves are better and more certain. Put them up warm in stone or, glass
      jars with broad flat corks; and tie kid leather over them.

      japan servers, and set them in the hot sun for three or four days;
      carefully taking them in at evening, and if the weather becomes damp or
      cloudy. Afterwards put them into a cullender or sieve,<span class="pagenum"><a

      water, and then wipe them all dry with a coarse cloth. Put them into a

      mace; a quarter of a pound of ground ginger; two nutmegs, powdered; two
      pounds of powdered loaf sugar; half a bottle of the best ground mustard;
      half a pound of yellow mustard seed, and an ounce of turmeric powder,
      which must on no account be omitted, as a yellow tinge is indispensable to
      this pickle. Mix all the seasoning with sufficient excellent cider vinegar
      to render it liquid, and pour it over the pickles in the pan, and then
      stir them up from the bottom. Let the whole rest till cold. Then transfer
      it to stone jars. Have ready some more vinegar, pour it boiling hot on the

      <i>Peach Mangoes.</i>&mdash;The above sort of peaches are best for
      mangoes. Steep them in brine for two days. Cut a small piece out of each,
      and carefully loose the stones from the inside with a small sharp knife.
      It will then be easy to thrust them out of free-stone peaches, and none
      others should be used, either for pickling or preserving. Make a filling
      for the places that were occupied by the stones. For this purpose, use
      fresh mustard seed moistened with vinegar; scraped horse-radish, powdered
      ginger, a clove of garlic, or a minced shalot or very small onion, and a
      very little chilli or red pepper minced very small. Also a little powdered
      mace, and a little chopped peach. With this mixture stuff the peaches
      hard. Replace the bits that were cut off, and tie them on firmly with fine
      packthread, crossing the peach. Boil a quart of the best vinegar, seasoned
      with white spices and mustard seed, tied up in muslin; and when it has
      boiled ten minutes, pour it hot over the peach mangoes in a stone jar. Add
      at the top a table-spoonful of salad oil; cork the jar immediately, and
      tie leather over it. Where there is no dislike to cloves, you may stick
      half a dozen into the outside of each peach; but we think a<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span> few
      small bits of mace will be preferable, as the clove taste will overpower
      every thing else.

      MELON MANGOES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take the small green melons, used only for this purpose, and let them lie
      in a strong brine for two days. Take them out and drain them well. Cut a
      small square bit out of one side, and through this hole extract all the
      seeds and filaments. Have ready a stuffing made of grated horse-radish,
      white mustard seed, minced shalot, or a clove of garlic chopped fine; a
      very little chilli or red pepper, and a little powdered mace. Wet this
      stuffing well with vinegar, and then fill with it the cavity of the mango.
      Replace the bit that was cut out, and tie it in with packthread, crossing
      all over the melon. Then place the mangoes in a stone jar. Have ready a
      sufficiency of the best vinegar, (a large quart or more, for eight or ten
      mangoes,) boiled ten minutes, with a seasoning of mustard seed, ginger,
      mace, grated horse-radish, and chopped shalot or little onion, or a clove
      of garlic minced very small&mdash;all tied in a bit of muslin. Pour the
      vinegar boiling hot over the mangoes, having placed among them the bag of
      seasoning. Finish with sweet oil at the top of the jar.

      MUSHROOMS PICKLED.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      For pickling, the small button mushrooms are best. After cutting off the
      stalk closely, and with a sharp penknife<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span> peeling off carefully their
      thin outside skin, measure two quarts, taking care that they are all of
      the right sort, and freshly gathered; the outside of a dull whitish color,
      and the underside of a fine pinkish salmon tinge. If very white above and
      below, or if bright yellow, they are poisonous. <i>Good</i> mushrooms grow
      always in open fields or airy places; never in woods or marshes. To pickle
      two quarts, prepare eight little bags of very clear muslin; and tie up in
      each bag six blades of mace, six slices of root ginger, and half a nutmeg
      broken up. Have ready four glass jars, such as are considered to hold a
      quart. Lay a bag of spice in the bottom of each. Having sprinkled the
      mushrooms well with salt, let them rest till next day. Then divide the
      mushrooms and their liquor into four pints. Put one pint into each jar,
      with a bag of spice at the bottom, and another at the top. Pour on boiling
      cider vinegar of the best quality, and finish with a table-spoonful of
      salad oil. Cork the jars immediately, and tie leather carefully over the
      top. All mushrooms turn brown on the under-side the day after they are
      gathered, and sometimes sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boiling the spice in the vinegar will weaken the mushroom flavor. When you
      open a jar of pickled mushrooms, immediately cork it again; tie on the
      leather cover, and use it up as soon as possible. Therefore, pint jars,
      with half a pint of mushrooms in each, are convenient.<span class="pagenum"><a

      BELL-PEPPERS PICKLED.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take fine full-grown bell-peppers. Make a brine in a stone jar of salt and
      water, strong enough to float an egg, and let the peppers remain in it two
      days, putting a weight on the cover to keep it down. Then take them out,
      wash them well in cold water, drain them, and wipe them dry. Cut a slit in
      the side of each, and extract all the seeds, as if left in, they will be
      entirely too hot. Through these slits let all the water run out. Put them
      into a clean stone jar. Boil sufficient of the best cider vinegar,
      interspersed with the muslin bags of broken-up cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg.
      Pour it, boiling hot, on the peppers in the jar. Distribute the bags of
      spice among the peppers, and cork the jar warm. You may stuff the peppers
      in the manner of mangoes, with pickled red cabbage finely shred, minced
      onions and minced cucumbers pickled, and seasoned with a little mustard
      seed, ginger, and mace. Tie up the slit with packthread, crossing all
      round. Fill up the jars with vinegar, putting sweet oil on the top.

      Your may green bell-peppers in the usual way, with vine leaves or cabbage
      leaves.

    <p>
      All pickles should be kept in a dry place. If you find them mouldy they
      are not always spoiled. Take them out of the jar, wipe off all the mould
      carefully, and throw away the vinegar. Wash the jar very clean, scald it,
      and set it in the sun to purify still more. Make a new pickle with fresh
      seasoning, and put them into that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575"

      PICKLED CAULIFLOWERS.&mdash;

      Take large, ripe, full-blown cauliflowers. Remove the leaves and stalk,
      and divide the blossom into pieces or clusters of equal size. Throw them
      into a porcelain kettle of boiling water, (adding a little salt,) let them
      simmer, and skim them well. When they come to a boil, take them up with a
      perforated skimmer, and lay them on a sieve to drain. Put them into stone
      jars, (three parts full.) Season with mace and nutmeg infused in
      sufficient of the best cider vinegar, and simmer it for a quarter of an
      hour. When it comes to a boil take it off the fire, and pour it hot over
      the cauliflower in the jar, filling quite up to the top, and adding sweet
      oil at the last. Cover it while warm, and tie leather over the top. If you
      wish to have the cauliflowers yellow, boil with the vinegar some turmeric
      powder tied up in thin muslin. This is a very nice pickle.

      some nutmeg. Pour the vinegar, boiling hot, upon the cabbage and beet,
      till you have the jars quite full. Finish with a large table-spoonful of

      PICKLED CUCUMBERS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take small young cucumbers, freshly gathered, and free from blemishes.
      Make a brine strong enough to float an egg, and let the cucumbers lie in
      it till they become yellow, stirring them down to the bottom twice a day.
      Then pour off all the brine, wash the cucumbers in cold water, and drain
      them. Lay a thick bed of fresh green vine leaves in the bottom and sides
      of a porcelain kettle. Put in the cucumbers, and pour on sufficient cold
      water to wet them all plentifully. Then cover them, closely, with more
      vine leaves, and pour on more water, packing the leaves well and pressing
      them down. Fill up to the top with water and vine leaves, and cover the
      kettle closely to keep in the steam. Hang it over a slow fire where there
      is no blaze, and keep it <i>warm</i> all night, but not <i>hot</i>. In the
      morning if the pickles are not a fine deep green, remove the vine leaves
      and replace them with a fresh supply. After this, they will be generally
      green enough; but if not, continue till they are. Then drain the cucumbers
      on a sieve, and trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>fer
      them to a very clean stone jar. To fifty cucumbers allow four quarts of
      excellent vinegar, and a bit of alum about the size of a large grain of
      corn, with half an ounce of mustard seed, half an ounce of mace, a
      broken-up nutmeg, and half an ounce of root ginger, sliced. Tie up the
      spice in three muslin bags, and boil them ten minutes in the vinegar. Then
      take out and lay them among the cucumbers in the jar; one to the bottom,
      one in the middle, and one at the top. Pour over them the vinegar boiling
      hot; add a table-spoonful of sweet oil, and cork the jar immediately,
      tying a leather over it. Keep wooden pickle spoons in the pantry for
      taking out pickles, and always be careful to close the jar immediately
      after.

      You need not keep the bags of spice in the jars more than two or three

      PICKLED ONIONS.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      Take the small silver-skinned white onions. Peel off the outer skin. Make
      a brine strong enough to float an egg, skim it well, and when it begins to
      cool pour it upon the onions. Let them stand in it (closely covered,) till
      quite cold. Then take them out, peel off another skin, and wash them
      through a cullender in cold water. Next, boil them in milk till tender all
      through, so that you can easily pierce them with a needle. Then drain off
      the milk. Measure them, and to a quart of onions allow a quart of the best
      cider vinegar. Boil in the vinegar two muslin bags tied up with broken-up<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span> nutmeg
      and mace. When it has boiled, pour it hot over the onions in the jar;
      having laid one bag of spice at the bottom, and one in the middle. The
      onions should fill two thirds of the jar, and the vinegar the remainder.
      Finish with a table-spoonful of salad oil, and cork the jar immediately,
      and tie on the leather cover.

      As onions pickled this way are generally much liked, it is well, when
      doing them, to make several jars full.

      <i>Cucumber and Onion Pickle.</i>&mdash;To a dozen fine cucumbers allow
      three large onions. Pare the cucumbers and peel the onions, and cut both
      into thick slices. Sprinkle salt and pepper over them, and let them rest
      till next day. Then drain them well, and put them into a stone jar. Pour
      boiling vinegar over them. Close the jar, and set it in a warm place. Next
      day repeat the boiling vinegar, and cork the jar. Next day repeat it
      again, with a bag of mace, nutmeg, and ginger, boiled in the vinegar. Then
      cork the jar, and tie it up. When the pickle is finished, divide it in
      small stone jars, with sweet oil on the top of each.

      WALNUTS OR BUTTERNUTS PICKLED&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Gather them in early summer, when they are full-grown, but so tender that
      a large needle will easily pierce them all through. Rub off the outer skin
      with a coarse cloth, and then lay them in salt and water for a week,
      changing the brine every other day. Allow for this brine a small<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span> quarter
      of a pound of salt to a large quart of water. Make enough to cover all the
      nuts well. Place a large lid over the pan, and keep them closely from the
      air. The last day take them out of the brine, drain them, and prick every
      one quite through in several places with a large needle. Drain them again,
      spread them out on large flat dishes, and set them to blacken for two days
      in the hot sun. For a hundred nuts, allow a gallon of excellent cider
      vinegar, half an ounce of black pepper-corns, half an ounce of cloves,
      half an ounce of allspice, an ounce of root ginger, and an ounce of mace.
      Boil the spice in the vinegar for ten minutes, tied up in eight small
      muslin bags. Then take them out, and having divided the nuts in four stone
      jars, distribute among them, equally, the bags of spice, and pour on the
      vinegar hot, an equal portion in each jar. While warm, secure them with
      flat corks, and tie leather over them. Done this way, you may begin to use
      them in a week. If you have not enough of vinegar to fill the jars up to
      the top, add some cold, and strew among the nuts some blades of mace.
      Finish with a large spoonful of salad oil at the top of each jar.

      PICKLED PLUMS.&mdash;

      Take large fine plums; perfect, and quite ripe. To every quart of plums
      allow half a pound of the best white sugar powdered, and a large pint of
      the best cider vinegar. Melt the sugar in the vinegar, and put it with the<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span> fruit
      into a porcelain kettle; all the plums having been previously pricked to
      the stone with a large needle. Lay among them some small muslin bags
      filled with broken nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon; and if you choose, a few
      cloves. Give them one boil up, skimming them well. Put them warm into
      stone jars, with the bags interspersed, and cork them immediately. Green
      gages may be done in this manner, first rendering them greener by boiling
      with vine leaves in the usual way.

    <p>
      <i>Damsons Pickled.</i>&mdash;Do these in the same manner as plums; but as
      they are much more acid, allow brown sugar of the best kind. Plums or
      damsons may be pickled plain, and with little trouble if full ripe,
      pricked with a needle, and packed down in a stone jar with profuse layers
      of brown sugar between the layers of fruit; the jars filled up with cold
      cider vinegar, and putting sweet oil at the top.

      <i>Pickled Cherries.</i>&mdash;Take the largest and finest red cherries,
      fully ripe. Morellas are the best. Either remove the stems entirely, or
      cut them short, within two inches of the fruit. Have ready a large glass
      jar. Fill it two thirds with fresh newly-gathered cherries, and then fill
      up to the top with the best vinegar. Keep it well covered, and if both
      fruit and vinegar are of excellent quality, no boiling is necessary, and
      no spice, as the cherry flavor will be retained, and they will not
      shrivel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>

    <p>
      <i>Button Tomatos.</i>&mdash;The small round tomatos, either red or
      yellow, will keep perfectly, if put whole into cold vinegar of the <i>really</i>
      best quality. You may add a bag of spice if you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Nasturtion Seeds.</i>&mdash;Keep a large glass jar of cold cider
      vinegar, and put in the green seeds of nasturtions after the flowers are
      off, and the seeds full-grown, but not hard. Remove the stalks. In this
      simple way nasturtions will keep perfectly well, and are an excellent
      substitute for capers with boiled mutton. They can be raised profusely,
      even in a city garden, and the blossoms are very beautiful. With
      pepper-grass and nasturtion flowers from your own garden, you can have a
      nice salad for a summer evening tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three pickles above (cherries, button tomatos, and nasturtion seeds,)
      are cheap, easy, and palatable. Try them. To flavor them with spice, boil
      the vinegar with a bag of spice in it, and pour it on hot, leaving the bag
      among them in the jar.

      thicken it with two spoonfuls of arrow root, if no vegetables are
      permitted. Otherwise, you may boil with the chicken some sliced onion and
      sliced turnip, with a grated parsnip and a sliced potato, straining out
      the vegetables with the shreds of fowl. You may reserve the white meat of
      the breast and wings to make another dish, if the patient is permitted to
      take it. This is the white meat cut off the bones, and stewed slowly in
      fresh oyster liquid, with a bit of nice butter. If the patient is well
      enough, stir in a beaten egg just before the stew is taken from the fire.

    <p>
      <i>Oyster Soup for Invalids.</i>&mdash;Remove the gristle from a dozen
      fine large fresh oysters. Take half their liquor and mix it with an equal
      portion of very good milk, seasoning it with three or four blades of mace,
      and a stalk of celery scraped and cut into pieces. When it has boiled and
      been skimmed well, strain it over the oysters, and let all simmer together

      if without salt or pepper. When done, strain it into a bowl. Let the
      patient eat with it a slice of very light wheat bread, having the crust
      cut off. It is excellent for the dysentery. When the patient is
      convalescent, a little seasoning may be allowed, and some well-boiled
      mashed turnips stirred into the bowl of soup with a boiled onion sliced,
      and a thickening of arrow-root or farina, stirred in about half an hour

      to it the soft part, only, of half a dozen fine oysters, and three or four
      blades of mace. Set it again on the fire, and as soon as it simmers well,
      take it off, and serve it up with very light milk biscuit, or little bread
      rolls, to eat with it. Veal broth may be made with a piece of knuckle of
      veal cut small, and boiled in the liquor of clams instead of water. The
      clams themselves must be omitted, as they are always tough and
      indigestible for an invalid, but their liquor adds a pleasant<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span> relish
      to the insipidity of the veal. As the strength of the patient improves, a
      grated carrot, a sliced onion, and some sliced turnip, may be added to the
      veal from the beginning.

    <p>
      <i>Raw Oysters for the Sick.</i>&mdash;Take large fine fresh oysters, and
      carefully cut out the hard part or gristle. They are considered very good
      for convalescents, being, when raw, cooling, refreshing, and nutritious.
      Drain them well from the liquor, making them as dry as you can; and if
      permitted, accompany the oysters with black pepper and vinegar, and a
      plate of bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Birds.</i>&mdash;Convalescents, not yet allowed to eat meat, can
      generally relish birds nicely broiled, or stewed in their own gravy, with
      any appropriate seasoning, and a little <i>fresh</i> butter, if they are
      not very fat. When dished, lay under each a piece of nice toast, dipped
      for a minute in hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Beefsteak for Invalids.</i>&mdash;When this can be eaten with an
      appetite, there is no greater promoter of returning health; but it must be
      of the best sirloin steak, very tender, well broiled, and thoroughly done
      on both sides, the gravy being carefully saved to serve up with it, a
      little fresh butter being added after the meat comes off the gridiron. If
      the taste of onion is desired, merely rub the plate with a peeled onion. A
      very tender lamb-chop well broiled may be eaten by way of change; but a
      tenderloin steak is better. Avoid pork, or veal cutlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gravy Sippets.</i>&mdash;For invalids who cannot yet eat meat, a light
      and relishing preparation may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585"
      id="Page_585">[585]</a></span> made with one or two slices of the best
      wheat bread, divested of the crust, and spread on a hot plate, while some
      nice well-skimmed gravy is poured over them; the gravy of roast beef,
      veal, or mutton, that has had no butter about it. Gravy sippets will form
      a variety to the usual broths, and other beginnings for the resumption of
      animal food.

      HERB TEAS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Have one or more china or white-ware pots for the purpose of making herb
      teas; and see that, after using, they are well washed, well scalded and
      dried, and set open in the sun till wanted again. The herbs, whether green
      or dried, should be of excellent quality, and picked very clean from dust
      and stems. Having well-scalded the pot, take the allotted quantity of the
      herb and put it in; then pour on the water, which must be actually boiling
      at the time, and press the herbs down at the bottom with a silver spoon.
      Then put on the lid closely, and immediately stop up the spout with a
      small cork, or a wad of soft white paper rolled tightly. This is to keep
      in the steam, and prevent the strength of the herb from escaping. When
      sufficiently boiled, pour into a pitcher with a lid, and through a
      strainer, as much of the tea as is wanted. Strainers of block tin, with a
      handle and <i>very fine</i> close holes, are excellent for this and other
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Herb Candies.</i>&mdash;Hoarhound candy, and many others, may be made
      of a strong decoction or tea of the herb, thickened with loaf sugar, and
      boiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
      skimmed, and stirred till very thick and stiff. Then pour it smoothly into
      a square tin pan and set it in a cool place to congeal. While still soft,
      mark it in even squares with a knife. When quite cold and hard, loosen it
      from the pan with a knife, and take it out. It is good for coughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peppermint candy is made in the same way, and is used for flatulence.

      Gruels, for patients who are unable to take any thing more substantial,

      the above articles; then stir the paste, gradually, into a pint of water
      boiling on the fire, making it very smooth and pressing out all the lumps.
      To prevent it boiling over, when it has risen nearly to the top of the
      pan, remove it from the fire. Sweeten it while hot, and, if permitted, add
      a little white wine with nutmeg, and a small bit of fresh butter.

      Stir a table-spoonful of currant jelly into a half pint tumbler of ice

      sweet and mixed with cold water, is a good substitute when sweetmeats are
      not at hand. Warm drinks are now seldom used, but to promote perspiration
      and carry off a cold. Tamarinds are in themselves very cooling and

    <p class="hdin">
      Carrageen is a species of sea moss which becomes glutinous when boiled,
      and is considered remarkably nutritious and strengthening. It can also be
      rendered very palatable. It is found abundantly on some parts of our
      sea-coast, and may be obtained of the best druggists, very nicely cleaned
      and pressed. To a small loose handful of carrageen allow a small quart of
      rich unskimmed milk, half a pound of powdered white sugar, a stick of the
      best cinnamon broken-up, six or seven blades of mace, and half a nutmeg,
      powdered. Having washed the carrageen through two or three cold waters,
      and shaken it out to remove the drops that hang about it, put it to a pint
      and a half of the cold milk. Boil it half an hour in a covered porcelain
      kettle. Then take it out, for if it boils too long the carrageen will
      taste too strongly. In another vessel boil the remaining half pint of milk

      the porcelain kettle again over the fire, and let it boil fast for five
      minutes longer. Then strain it into moulds or bowls previously wet with
      cold water; and when it has well congealed, turn it out, and serve it up
      with sweetened cream, flavored with rose-water or peach-water. If for an

      cinnamon to flavor it well; the spices being tied up in a very thin muslin

      four large heaping table-spoonfuls of farina, stirring it well. Keep it
      boiling a quarter of an hour after all the farina is in. When done, strain
      it into blancmange moulds, and set it on ice to congeal. If for an invalid
      not allowed spice, boil it plain, and when taken from the fire stir in a

      boil steadily for three hours, by which time the essence will be all
      extracted from the beef. Then remove the cork, and strain the liquid into
      a bowl, and skim it. It can be made still more conveniently in a <i>bain-marie</i>
      or double kettle; an article useful for many purposes, particular in

      the whole over the toast. Cover it with a plate for a few minutes, and eat
      it while warm, previous to going to bed. This is a wholesome strengthening
      palatable supper for an invalid, (as we know by experience) and may be
      continued as long as the patient continues to like it. It is always a good

      TEA.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      No metal (not even silver,) is good for tea-pots. All tea should be made
      in china or queensware. Wedgewood (whether black or white) imbibes much of
      the essence of the tea, and from constant use soon becomes unpleasant.
      Britannia ware is exceedingly unwholesome for any sort of cooking, as one
      fourth of the composition is copper. Block tin for a common tea-pot is
      less objectionable, and much cheaper. All tea-pots should, after using, be
      thoroughly emptied of the old leaves, and washed very clean in warm water,
      and set open in the sun and air for several hours. To make good tea, the
      tea itself, whether black or green, must be of excellent quality. There is
      no economy in buying that which is low-priced. Green tea, if fresh and
      good, and not adulterated will look green in the cup, and have a fragrant
      odor. If it draws red, or brown, or blackish, it is old or mixed with
      something wrong. Begin to make your tea about a quarter of an hour before
      it is wanted. Scald the tea-pot (twice over) with boiling water. Then put
      in the tea, allowing three heaping table-spoonfuls to each<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span> person,
      and a pint of water, actually boiling, when put in. Cover it closely with
      the lid, and set it by the fire for ten or fifteen minutes to infuse.
      After the first cups have gone round, put some fresh tea into the pot, and
      pour on it some more boiling water, that the second cups may be as strong
      as the first, having time to infuse. Weak tea for company is very mean.
      For those that like it so, have a small pot of water on the server. If the
      water is not boiling fast when poured on the tea, and is beginning to
      cool, the tea will be flat and insipid, and the leaves will float on the
      surface of the cups. There is then no remedy but to make some fresh.

      COFFEE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      To drink coffee in perfection, a sufficient quantity for breakfast should
      be roasted every morning, and ground hot, as it loses much of its strength
      by keeping even for a few hours. The best coffee roasters are iron
      cylinders, (standing on feet) with a door in one side, and a handle that
      turns the cylinder round towards the fire or from it, that the coffee may
      be equally done throughout. It must be roasted a bright brown color, and
      on no account black or burnt. When about half done, put in bits of fresh
      butter, allowing a table-spoonful to a pound of coffee. Previous to
      roasting pick the coffee carefully, throwing away the defective grains,
      and the stones or sand. Coffee should be ground while warm in a<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span> mill
      kept solely for that purpose, and fastened up against the kitchen wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      For boiled coffee allow four ounces of ground coffee (or a quarter of a
      pound) to a quart of water. When the water boils, stir in the coffee. Give
      it one hard boil up. Then set it farther from the fire, and simmer it for
      ten minutes, adding the white of an egg, (including the egg shell,) or a
      small strip of isinglass. Pour out a large cup of the coffee, and then
      (holding it high above the coffee-pot,) pour it back again. Repeat this
      till wanted, and then set the coffee-pot beside the fire, (but not over
      it.) For company, allow six ounces of coffee to a quart of water. Keep the
      lid always on, but if when boiling hard it rises and seems inclined to run
      over, remove it instantly from the fire and set it back. Cream is
      indispensable to first-rate coffee; if not to be obtained sweet,
      substitute rich milk boiling hot. On no consideration fill up the
      coffee-pot with water. A percolator (to be had at the best tin stores)
      makes excellent coffee without boiling, if properly managed.

      CHOCOLATE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      There is no plain chocolate better than Baker's prepared cacao, and none
      has so much of the true chocolate flavor. The foreign chocolate is
      generally mixed with sugar, spice, and milk. It cannot be made thick and
      strong, and therefore to many tastes is not agreeable. To make a pint (or
      two large cupfuls of chocolate,) scrape down two ounces on a plate, and
      moisten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
      the chocolate with a jill of water, rubbing it on the plate till quite
      smooth. Then boil it five minutes, and add a small pint of water. When it
      has been well stirred with a wooden spoon, and has come again to a boil,
      serve it as hot as possible, accompanied by a saucer of fine loaf sugar,
      and a small jug of rich hot cream and a plate of nice dry toast, or some
      milk biscuits or sponge cake. Milled chocolate is made with rich unskimmed
      milk instead of water. The chocolate mill is a deep pot, belonging to
      which is a stick with a broad wheel-shaped bottom, the other end coming up
      through a hole in the lid. Take this between your hands, and turn it round
      fast till the chocolate is finely frothed. Then transfer it to large cups.
      Chocolate, after it becomes cold, is unfit to drink. But if made with
      milk, you can convert what is left into a custard or pudding, with the
      addition of more sugar and some beaten egg. The low-priced chocolate is
      both unpalatable and unwholesome, being adulterated with animal fat or
      lard, and made with <i>old</i> cacao beans.

      MACARONI.&mdash;

    <p class="hdin">
      In buying macaroni, choose that of a large pipe; see that it is clean and
      white and that it has not been touched by insects. Half a pound makes one
      dish. If <i>soaked</i> before boiling it is apt to dissolve or go to
      pieces, but wash and drain it through cold water in a sieve. Have over the
      fire a large pan of boiling water, in which has been melted a piece of
      fresh butter the size of an egg. If boiled steadily, it will be quite
      tender in less than an hour; but do not boil it so long that the pipes
      break up and lose their shape. Having drained it well through a clean
      sieve, transfer it to a deep dish, dividing it into four layers, having
      first cut it into even lengths of two or three inches. Between the layers
      place on it seasoning of grated cheese of the very best qua<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>lity, and
      bits of fresh butter, with some powdered mace. On the top layer, add to
      the covering of cheese and butter sufficient bread-crumbs to form a slight
      crust all over the surface. Brown it with a salamander or a red hot
      shovel. Or (omitting the cheese) you may dress it with rich gravy of roast

      Beat five eggs till very light and thick. Stir gradually into the pan of

      tea-cup of milk. Take a yeast powder; dissolve the soda (from the blue

      the batter. In another cup melt the tartaric acid, (from the white paper;)
      stir that into the mixture, and stir the whole very hard. Have ready in a
      frying-pan a large portion of lard, boiling hot. Put in the omelet
      mixture, and fry it well. When one side is done turn it, and fry the
      other. To flavor this omelet, mix gradually into the batter either grated
      ham or smoked tongue; minced oysters; minced onion; mixed<span

    <p>
      <i>For a Sweet Omelet</i>, add to the above batter powdered sugar, nutmeg,
      mace, and powdered cinnamon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The custom is now to dish omelets without folding them over, it being
      found that folding renders them heavy. Spread them out at full length on a
      very hot dish. The batter for omelets should always be made in sufficient
      quantity to allow them very thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no use in attempting to flavor an omelet, or any thing else, with
      marmalade or lemon, if you put in soda. The alkalies destroy the taste of
      every sort of fruit.

      for it makes them bitter. Then strain the liquid into a pan, and add a
      table-spoonful of brown sugar and one of salt. When lukewarm, stir in
      flour enough to make a thick batter. Add a jill and a half of fresh
      baker's yeast. Set it in a warm place till it begins to ferment; then keep
      it in the cellar well corked.

    <p>
      A stone jug or pitcher is a good vessel for yeast. Wash it very clean in

      Get two ounces of bicarbonate of soda, and one ounce of tartaric acid.
      Divide the soda into equal portions, about a level tea-spoonful in each,

      Mix together in a clean keg three gallons of clear rain water, (that has
      been caught in a clean tub without running over the roof of a house,) one
      quart of <i>West India</i> molasses, and one<span class="pagenum"><a

      Cover it, and set it in a warm place where it will be exposed to the
      summer sun. Remember to shake the cask every day. In three months it will
      be excellent vinegar. Then transfer it to stone jugs, and keep it closely

      So much of the vinegar sold in stores is concocted of pernicious drugs,
      that we recommend all families to make their own, or to buy it from a
      cider farmer. Good cider, set in the sun, will after a while become good
      vinegar.

    <p>
      What is shamefully called the best white wine vinegar is frequently a slow
      poison, as may be known by its action upon oysters, pickles, &amp;c. It is
      quite clear and well to look at. Its taste is very sharp and pungent, as
      to overpower and render every thing that is with it painfully sour, and it
      has a singular and disagreeable smell when boiling. Oysters cooked with
      this vinegar go immediately into rags, and are soon entirely eaten up, or
      dissolved into a thin whitish liquid, fit for nothing but to throw away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pickles the same. A punishment should be provided by law for persons who
      manufacture and sell these deleterious compounds, of which we have now so
      many, that it would indeed be well if we could make at home, as far as
      possible, every thing we eat and drink.

      and mix with them three quarts of ripe white currants. Bruise them all.
      Put nine pounds of loaf sugar to melt in three gallons of very clear soft
      water. Boil the water and sugar together for half an hour, skimming
      carefully, and pour the liquid boiling hot over the currants. When it is
      nearly cold, add a small tea-cupful of excellent strong fresh yeast. Let
      it ferment for two days, and then strain it into a small cask through a
      very clean hair sieve. Put into the cask half an ounce of finely-chipped
      isinglass. Have rather more liquor than will fill the cask at first, and
      keep it to fill up as it works over. In about a fortnight bung it up. Let
      it remain in the cask till April. Then transfer it to bottles, (putting
      into each a lump of double-refined loaf sugar,) and letting them remain
      one day uncorked. Then cork and wire them. They must stand upright in the

      EGGS TO BOIL.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The water must be boiling fast when the eggs are put in. First wipe them
      clean all over, with a wet cloth. It is true that the shells are never
      eaten, but still, if brought to table dirty and discolored, they look
      slovenly, disgusting, and vulgar, such as are never seen in good houses.
      Put them into water that is boiling fast; and if desired very soft, four
      minutes will be sufficient. Six or eight minutes will barely set the
      whites and yolks, and ten or twelve minutes (in water that is really
      boiling,) will render them hard enough for salad. In the egg-boilers that
      are set on the table no egg will ever boil hard, as the water cools too
      soon. A <i>stale</i> egg never boils hard.<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Except in the spring, and late in the winter, there is often much
      difficulty in obtaining good eggs, unless you have fowls of your own. If
      an egg is really fresh, when held up against the light, the yolk looks
      round and compact and the white clear and transparent; you may then trust
      it. But if the yolk is thick, broken, and mixed among the white, and the
      white is cloudy and muddled, it is certainly bad, and should be thrown
      away. When tried in a pan of cold water the freshest will sink, and the
      stale ones float on the surface. It requires strong brine to bear up a
      good egg. Eggs may be preserved for keeping a few months, by putting every
      one in fast boiling water for <i>one minute</i>. Then grease them all over
      the outside with good melted fat, and wedge down close together (layer
      above layer,) in a box of powdered charcoal. This preserves them for a sea
      voyage of several weeks. The charcoal box must be kept closely covered,
      and closed immediately whenever opened. Pack the eggs with the small end
      downwards.

      POACHED EGGS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      See that the eggs are quite fresh. Pour from a kettle of boiling water
      enough to fill a broad shallow stew-pan. Break the eggs into a saucer,
      (one at a time,) slip them carefully into the hot water, and let them
      stand in it till the whites are set. Then put the pan over a moderate
      fire; and, as soon as the water boils again, the eggs are ready. The
      whites should be firm, and the yolks should appear in the centre<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span> looking
      yellow through a thin transparent coating of the white. Take them out
      carefully (one by one,) with an egg-slice. Have ready, for each egg, a
      nice slice of toast of a light brown or yellow all over. Trim off all the
      crust, and dip the toast for a minute in hot water. Then butter it <i>slightly</i>
      with fresh butter. Trim off neatly the ragged and discolored white from
      the edge of each egg. Lay a poached egg in the middle of every toast, and
      serve them up warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of toast, you may lay beneath every egg a thin slice of ham, that
      has been soaked, and nicely broiled and trimmed. Or, large thin slices
      from the breast of a cold roast turkey, or cold fillet of roast pork or
      veal. These are nice breakfast dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Scrambled Eggs.</i>&mdash;Make a mixture as for an omelet, but instead
      of frying put it into a sauce-pan, and when it has boiled five minutes
      take it off, and chop and mix all the ingredients into confusion. Serve it
      up hot in a deep dish. It is eaten at breakfast, and is by many preferred
      to a fried omelet. You may season it with grated ham, tongue, or sweet
      herbs.

      EGG-NOGG.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Beat, till very light and thick, the yolks only of six eggs. Stir the
      eggs, gradually, into a quart of rich unskimmed milk, and add half a pound
      of powdered loaf sugar, a half pint of brandy, and a grated nutmeg. Next
      beat three whites of the eggs by themselves, and stir<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span> them quickly into the
      mixture. Divide it into two pitchers, and pour it back and forward from
      one pitcher to the other till it has a fine froth. Then serve it in a
      large china bowl, with a silver ladle in it, and distribute it in glasses
      with handles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Beat Eggs.</i>&mdash;For beating eggs have a broad shallow earthen
      pan. If beaten in tin, the coldness of the metal retards their lightness;
      for the same reason, hickory rods are better than tin wire. Beat with a
      short quick stroke, holding the egg rods in your right hand close to your
      side, and do not exert your elbow, or use your arm violently with a hard
      sweeping stroke; of this there is no necessity. If beaten in a proper
      manner, (moving your hand <i>only</i> at the wrist) the eggs will be light
      long before you are fatigued. But you must continue beating till after the
      froth has subsided, and the pan of eggs presents a smooth thick surface,
      like a nice boiled custard. White of egg is done if it stands stiff alone,
      and will not fall from the beater when held upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Butter and sugar should always be stirred with a strong hickory spaddle,
      which resembles a short mush stick, rather broad and flattened at one end.

      A SOUFFLÉ PUDDING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take eight rusks, or soft sugar-biscuits, or plain buns. Lay them in a
      large deep dish, and pour on a pint of milk, sufficient to soak them
      thoroughly. Cover the dish, and let them stand undisturbed for about an
      hour and a half before dinner. In the mean time, boil half a pint of milk
      in a small sauce-pan with a handful of bitter almonds or peach kernels
      broken small, or a small bunch of fresh peach-leaves, with two large
      sticks of cinnamon, broken up. Boil this milk slowly, (keeping it
      covered,) and when it tastes strongly of the flavoring articles, strain
      it, and set it away to cool. When cold, mix it into another pint of milk,
      and stir in a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf sugar. Beat eight eggs
      very light, and add them gradually to the milk, so as to make a rich
      custard. After dinner has commenced, beat and stir the soaked rusk very
      hard till it becomes a smooth mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621"
      id="Page_621">[621]</a></span> and then, by degrees, add to it the
      custard. Stir the whole till thoroughly amalgamated. Set the dish into a
      brisk oven, and bake the pudding rather more than ten minutes. The yeast,
      &amp;c., in the rusk, will cause it to puff up very light. When done, send
      it to table warm, with white sugar sifted over it. You may serve up with
      it as sauce sweetened thick cream flavored with rose-water, and grated
      nutmeg, or powdered loaf sugar and fresh butter stirred together in equal
      portions, and seasoned with lemon or nutmeg.

      ICED PLUM PUDDING.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take two dozen sweet and half a dozen bitter almonds. Blanch them in
      scalding water, and then throw them into a bowl of cold water. Pound them
      one at a time in a mortar, till they become a smooth paste, free from the
      smallest lumps. As you proceed, add frequently a few drops of rose-water
      or lemon juice to make them light, and prevent their oiling. Seed and cut
      in half a quarter of a pound of the best bloom raisins. Mix with them a
      quarter of a pound of Zante currants, picked, washed, and dried; and add
      to the raisins and currants three ounces of citron, chopped. Mix the
      citron with the raisins and currants, and dredge them all with flour to
      prevent their sinking or clodding. Take a half pint of very rich milk;
      split a vanilla bean, and cut it into pieces two or three inches long, and
      boil it in the milk till the flavor of the vanilla is well extracted; then
      strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
      it out, and mix the vanilla milk with a pint of rich cream, and stir in,
      gradually, a half pound of powdered loaf sugar, and a nutmeg grated. Then
      add the pounded almonds, and a large wine-glass of either marasquino,
      noyau, curaçoa, or the very best brandy. Beat, in a shallow pan, the yolks
      of eight eggs till very light, thick, and smooth, and stir them gradually
      into the mixture. Simmer it over the fire, (stirring it all the time,) but
      take it off just as it is about to come to a boil, otherwise it will
      curdle. Then, while the mixture is hot, stir in the raisins, currants, and
      citron. Set it to cool, and then add a large tea-cupful of preserved
      strawberries or raspberries, half a dozen preserved apricots or peaches;
      half a dozen preserved green limes; and any other very nice and delicate
      sweetmeats. Then whip to a stiff froth another pint of cream, and add it
      lightly to the mixture. Put the whole into a large melon-mould that opens
      in the middle, and freeze it in the usual way. It will take four hours to
      freeze it well. Do not turn it out till just before it is wanted. Then
      send it to table on a glass dish. It will be found delicious. Iced
      puddings are now considered indispensable on fashionable supper tables or
      at dinner parties. There is no flour in this pudding. The freezing will
      keep it together.

      RENNETS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Milk turned into a curd with wine is by no means so good as that which is
      done with rennet-water alone. The curd and<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span> whey do not separate so
      completely; the curd is less firm, and the whey less clear; the latter
      being thick and white, instead of thin and greenish, as it ought to be.
      Neither is it so light and wholesome as when turned with rennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rennets of the best quality can be had at all seasons in the Philadelphia
      market; particularly in the lower part, called the Jersey market. They are
      sold at twelve, eighteen, or twenty-five cents, according to their size,
      and will keep a year or two; but have most strength when fresh. You may
      prepare excellent rennets yourself at a very trifling expense, by
      previously bespeaking them of a veal butcher; a rennet being the stomach
      of a calf. Its form is a bag. As soon as you get the rennet, empty out all
      its contents, and wipe it very clean, inside and out; then rince it with
      cold water, but do not wash it much, as washing will weaken its power of
      turning milk into curd. When you have made it quite clean, lay the rennet
      in a broad pan, strew it over on both sides with plenty of fine salt;
      cover it, and let it rest five days. When you take it out of the pan, do
      not wipe or wash it, for it must be stretched and dried with the salt on.
      For this purpose hold it open like a bag, and slip within it a long,
      thick, smooth rod, bent into the form of a large loop wide at the top, and
      so narrow at the bottom as to meet together. Stretch the rennet tightly
      and smoothly over this bent rod, on which it will be double, and when you
      have brought the two ends of the rod together at the bottom, and tied them
      fast, the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
      will somewhat resemble that of a boy's kite. Hang it up in a dry place,
      and cut out a bit as you want it. A piece about two inches square will
      turn one quart of milk; a piece of four inches, two quarts. Having first
      washed off all the salt in several cold waters, and wiped the bit of
      rennet dry, pour on it sufficient <i>lukewarm</i> water to cover it well.
      Let it stand several hours; then pour the rennet-water into the milk you
      intend for the curd, and set it in a warm place. When the curd is entirely
      formed, set the vessel on ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rennet may be used with good effect before it has <i>quite</i> dried.

      AN EASY WAY OF MAKING BUTTER IN WINTER.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      The following will be found an excellent method of making butter in cold
      weather for family use. We recommend its trial. Take, in the morning, the
      unskimmed milk of the preceding evening, (after it has stood all night in
      a <i>tin</i> pan,) and set it over a furnace of hot coals, or in a stove;
      being careful not to disturb the cream that has risen to the surface. Let
      it remain over the fire till it simmers, and begins to bubble round the
      edges; but on no account let it come to a boil. Then take the pan
      carefully off, (without disturbing the cream) and carry it to a cool
      place, but not where it is cold enough to freeze. In the evening take a
      spoon, and loosen the cream round the sides of the pan. If very rich, it
      will be almost a solid cake. Slip off the sheet of cream<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span> into
      another and larger pan, letting as little milk go with it as possible.
      Cover it, and set it away. Repeat the process for several days, till you
      have thus collected a sufficiency of clotted cream to fill the pan. Then
      scald a wooden ladle, and beat the cream hard with it during ten minutes.
      You will then have excellent butter. Take it out of the pan, lay it on a
      flat dish, and with the ladle squeeze and press it hard, till all the
      buttermilk is entirely extracted and drained off. Then wash the butter in
      cold water, and work a very little salt into it. Set it away in a cool
      place for three hours. Then squeeze and press it again; also washing it a
      second time in cold water. Make it up into pats, and keep it in a cool
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unskimmed morning's milk, of course, may also be used for this
      purpose, after it has stood twelve hours. The simmering over the fire adds
      greatly to the quantity of cream, by throwing all the oily part of the
      milk to the surface; but if allowed to boil, this oleaginous matter will
      again descend, and mix with the rest, so as not to be separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the usual method of making winter butter in the south of England;
      and it is very customary in the British provinces of America. Try it.

      slices of bread, slightly buttered, and with the crust cut off. Put a
      thick layer of currants on the bread, and then a layer of sugar. Then
      other layers of bread, currants, and sugar, till the dish is full;
      finishing at the top with very thin slices of bread. Set it into the oven,
      and bake it half an hour. Serve it either warm or cold; and eat it with
      sweetened cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of currants you may take cherries, (first stoning them all,)
      raspberries, ripe blackberries, or barberries, plums, (first extracting
      the stones,) stewed cranberries, or stewed gooseberries. If the fruit is
      previously stewed, the pudding will require but ten minutes' baking. When
      it is sent to table, have sugar at hand in case it should not be sweet
      enough.

      ICE-CREAM CAKES.&mdash;

      Stir together, till very light, a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar and
      a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Beat six eggs very light, and stir
      into them a half pint of rich milk. Add, gradually, the eggs and milk to

      cups that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
      been well buttered, filling them about two thirds with the batter. Set
      them immediately into a brisk oven, and bake them brown. When done, remove
      them from the cups, and place them to cool on an inverted sieve. When
      quite cold make a slit or incision in the side of each cake. If very
      light, and properly baked, they will be hollow in the middle. Fill up this
      cavity with ice cream, carefully put in with a spoon, and then close the
      slit with your fingers to prevent the cream running out. Spread them on a
      large dish. Either send them to table immediately before the ice-cream

      WHIPPED CREAM MERINGUES.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Take the whites of eight eggs, and beat them to a stiff froth that will
      stand alone. Then beat into them, gradually, (a tea-spoonful at a time,)
      two pounds or more of finely-powdered loaf sugar; continuing to add sugar
      till the mixture is very thick, and finishing with lemon juice or extract
      of rose. Have ready some sheets of white paper laid on a baking board, and
      with a spoon drop the mixture on it in long oval heaps, about four inches
      in length. Smooth and shape them with a broad-bladed knife, dipped
      occasionally in cold water. The baking board used for this purpose should
      be an inch thick, and must have a slip of iron beneath each end to elevate
      it from the floor of the oven, so that it may not scorch, nor the bottoms
      of the meringues be baked too hard. This baking-<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>board must not be of pine
      wood, as a pine board will communicate a disagreeable taste of turpentine.
      The oven must be moderate. Bake the meringues of a light brown. When cool,
      take them off the paper by slipping a knife nicely beneath the bottom of
      each. Then push back or scoop out carefully a portion of the inside of
      each meringue, taking care not to break them. Have ready some nice whipped
      cream, made in the following proportion:&mdash;Take a quarter of a pound
      of broken-up loaf sugar, and on some of the lumps rub off the yellow rind
      of two large lemons. Powder the sugar, and then mix with it the juice of
      the lemons, and grate in some nutmeg. Mix the sugar with a half pint of
      sweet white wine. Put into a pan a pint of rich cream, and whip it with
      rods or a wooden whisk, or mill it with a chocolate mill till it is a
      stiff froth. Then mix in, gradually, the other ingredients; continuing to
      whip it hard a while after they are all in. As you proceed, lay the froth
      on an inverted sieve, with a dish underneath to catch the droppings; which
      droppings must afterwards be whipped and added to the rest. Fill the
      inside of each meringue with a portion of the whipped cream. Then put two
      together, so as to form one long oval cake, joining them nicely, so as to
      unite the flat parts that were next the paper, leaving the inside filled
      with the whipped cream. Set them again in the oven for a few minutes. They
      must be done with great care and nicety, so as not to break. Each meringue
      should be about the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635"
      id="Page_635">[635]</a></span> length of a middle finger. In dropping them
      on the paper, take care to shape the oval ends handsomely and smoothly.
      They should look like very long kisses.

      Having been accidentally omitted in its proper place, we here insert a

      each pound of meat allow a quart of water. Put it into a soup-pot, with a
      slice of ham, which will render the soup sufficiently salt. Boil it
      slowly, and skim it well, till the scum ceases to appear. If you have no
      ham, season the meat, when you first put it in, with a tea-spoonful of
      salt. In the mean time prepare the vegetables, but do not put them in till
      the meat has boiled to rags, and all the scum has risen to the surface and
      been carefully removed. It is then time to strain out<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span> the shreds of meat and
      bone, return the soup to the pot, and add the vegetables. First, have
      ready the deep yellow <i>outsides</i> of three or four carrots grated, and
      stir them into the soup to enrich it, and give it a fine color. Next, add
      turnips, potatos, parsnips, salsify, celery, (including its green leaves
      from the top) and onions that have been already peeled and boiled by
      themselves to render them less strong. All the vegetables should be cut
      nicely into small pieces of equal size, (as for Soup à la Julienne.) You
      may add some boiled beets, handsomely sliced. And (if approved) strew in
      at the last a handful of fresh leaves of the marygold flower, which adds a
      flavor to some persons very agreeable. Put all these vegetables gradually
      into the soup, (those first that require the longest boiling,) and when
      they are all <i>quite done</i> the soup is finished. If well made, with a
      liberal allowance of meat and vegetables, and well boiled, it will be much

      THE BEST CEMENT FOR JARS.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      Before preserving and pickling time, buy at a druggist's, two ounces of
      the clearest and whitest gum tragacanth. Obtain also two grains of
      corrosive sublimate, (indispensable to this cement), and having picked the
      gum tragacanth clean, and free from dust and dark or discolored particles,
      put it with the sublimate into a very clean yellow or white-ware mug that
      holds a small quart and has a close-fitting lid belonging to it. Then fill
      the vessel more than two-thirds with very clean water, either warm or
      cold; and put on the lid. Let it rest till next morning. Then stir it with
      an <i>unpainted</i> stick, that will reach quite down to the bottom.
      Repeat the stirring frequently through the day, always replacing the lid.
      In a few days the cement will have risen to the top of the mug, and have
      become a fine, clear, smooth paste, <i>far superior to any other</i>; and,
      by means of the corrosive sublimate, it will keep perfectly well to an
      indefinite period, if always closely covered, and having no sort of metal
      dipped into it. On no account attempt to keep this paste in tin, or even
      in silver. Both paste and metal will turn black and become spotted.
      Remember this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When going to put away your sweetmeats or pickles, this paste will come
      into use, and be found invaluable. It is best to keep all these things in
      small jars, as opening a large jar frequently, may<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span> injure its contents by
      letting in the air. In a large family, or where many pickles are eaten,
      those in most frequent use may be kept in stone-ware jars, with a wooden
      spoon always at hand for taking them out when wanted. On the surface of
      every jar of pickles, put one or two table-spoonfuls of salad oil, and
      then cover the top of the jar closely with a circular piece of bladder or
      thin leather. Next cut out a narrow band of the same, and cement it on
      with gum tragacanth paste, (made as above), and let it remain till you
      open the jar for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      For sweetmeats, have glass or white-ware jars. Lay on the surface of each
      a circular paper, cut to fit and dipped in brandy. Next, put on an outside
      cover of bladder or thick white paper secured with a band of the same,
      coated with tragacanth paste. When this cement is used, the jars will not
      be infested with ants or other insects, the corrosive sublimate keeping
      them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paste should be at hand in every library or office, when wanted for
      papers or books. It requires no boiling when made, and is always ready,
      and never spoils. For a small quantity, take an ounce of the best gum
      tragacanth and a grain of corrosive sublimate. Get a covered white or
      yellow-ware mug that holds a pint; such a mug will cost but twelve cents.
      Dissolve in less than a pint of water.

      A BAIN-MARIE; OR, DOUBLE KETTLE.&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p class="hdin">
      These are most useful and satisfactory utensils,<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span> as all who have tried them
      can certify. They are to be had of various sizes at the best household
      furniture stores, and are made to order by the chief tinsmiths. The French
      make great use of the Bain-Marie; which, in some measure, accounts for the
      general superiority of their cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      This utensil, as made in America, is a double kettle of the strongest and
      best block-tin. The bottom of the outside kettle is of strong copper or
      iron, well tinned, and <i>kept so</i>. The food, however, is all contained
      in the inner kettle, which is of tin entirely. After the food is in,
      (having with it no water whatever), put on the lid tightly, and through
      the tube on the outside, pour into the outer kettle the water that is to
      cook it. If it boils away too fast, replenish it with more water poured in
      at the tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it boils too slowly, quicken it by adding some salt put in at the tube.
      Keep the kettle closely covered, except when removing the lid to take off
      the scum; and do this quick and seldom. The superfluous steam is all the
      time escaping through the top of the tube and through a very small hole in
      the lid. Nothing cooked in this manner (with all the water outside) can
      possibly burn or scorch. After every skimming, stir the stew down to the
      bottom before you replace the lid. To cook in a Bain-Marie, requires a
      strong, steady heat, well kept up; and you must begin earlier than in the
      common way of stewing. This is an excellent vessel for boiling custards,
      blancmanges, marmalades, and many other nice things; as a good<span
      class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
      housewife will soon discover. Also, for making beef tea and other
      preparations for invalids. It is well to keep a small one purposely for a
      sick room.
    </p>
    <p>
      If from deficiency of sugar, or being kept too warm, or not closely
      covered, any of your sweetmeats turn sour, do not hastily throw them away,
      but carefully remove the surface, (even if coated with blue mould), add an
      additional portion of sugar so as to make them very sweet, and put them
      into a Bain-Marie. Fill the outer kettle with <i>hot</i> water, and boil
      it till you find the preserves restored to their proper taste. Then put
      them up again in jars that have been well scalded, rinsed, and sunned, and
      lay brandied paper on the surface of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mouldy pickles may be recovered in a similar manner, adding fresh spices
      and vinegar before you put them up again.
